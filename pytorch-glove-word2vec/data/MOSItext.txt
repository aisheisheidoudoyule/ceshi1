 Hello hello I like coming too here and I wanna give you guys a review of the Green Hornet movie I was lucky enough to snag passes to the advanced screening of the Green Hornet here in New York City The movies isnt actually released till January but I got a sneak peek Just like the Spiderman play that Ive recently reviewed it is not in its final form the people that worked on the movie were there at the screening and they said they might still tweet a couple of things before the movie comes out But I can safely assure you that even if they didnt it would still be a hit I knew nothing about the Green Hornet going into this even though Im a comic fan I havent had the time to pick up the Green Hornet Or listen to the radio program or anything like that so I came with the fresh view I had no idea about anything and I loved it I dont know if fans of the comic would be as inclined to say the same because I dont know how much it differs from the comic or radio program that people like so much but just going into this a as an observer and someone who has no idea it was a fantastic film it was so much fun and I would tell you right now it was hilarious It was really really funny Seth Rogen plays the Green Hornet and most of you know hes a pretty funny guy and he funnied up this movie big time totally He had a hand in writing the skript I think I saw on the credits so that doesnt surprise me and the humor it was kind of necessary I feel like if they woudlnt have inserted the humor into this movie it wouldve been just too serious and kind of boring in a sense but the humor really just nailed it and the action sequences in this movie are tensed I love when people do this when they just come up with these totally completely new stylized ways of developing action sequences coz sure its fun to see a super hero go round and kick bad guy butt you know punch kick whatever bam but when they figure out a new way to interpret this and add something like an extra spark in there that makes it more visually truly appealing and just different it engages the audience more and I just really enjoyed it Just like Scott Pilgrim employed that kind of sound effect in text and that kind of video game mask quality The Green Hornet did something similar but they took a new spin on it and I just loved it And I feel like even though the fighting sequences were a little bit long in some places t we did see it in 2D and the movie is gonna be released in 3D so I meant if I was wearing 3D glasses and was seeing this in 3D I wouldve enjoyed it a lot more and I would want the sequences to be even longer rather than shorter So the premise of this movie that there is this guy who has a very rich father whose father dies he inherits his money he decides to become a villain of the night sort of speak and fight crime and clean up his city with a sidekick
 huh huh OK OK hello this is xxx man eleven here for review of XMen Origins Wolverine throat cleaning starring Hugh Jackman Liev Schreiber Danny Houston Ryan Reynolds Will I am and Taylor Kitsch and yes I just watched this a week ago most specifically July 27 so who ran off for over 3 dollar theater showings now the title of the movie basically says it all the movie shows the origins and backstory of famed Xman member Wolverine now Im not even gonna sugar coat this this movie frustrated me to such an extreme extent that I was loudly exclaiming why at the end of the film my reason Im a comic book fan that like to see comic book characters treated responsibly that huh before we go on with that I must say that this had a surprisingly decent cast strange since one of my biggest grapes with the Xman series was and always is the xxx now Hugh Jackman was always the best choice to play Wolverine I will admit that and in my opinion he carried the movie fine you know nothing great but you know he did it hes a star of the movie nothing special he carried it um also Liev Schreiber or Schreiber um I like calling him Liev Schreiber um is Victor Creed otherwise best known as Sabertooth which shes not called once in the whole movie which is a smart move since you know you have to be real comic book fan to get what hes name is supposed to be but its pretty selfexplanatory but going on um I actually think that Liev Schreiber is a good actor and he almost looks exactly the same as this character in Defiance I mean it was like he was too lazy to take off the costume or something now other performances are borderline OK but the two big character appearances in this movie are easily Deadpool and Gambit um Deadpool being Ryan Raynolds and Gambit being played by Taylor Kitsch Taylor Kitsch yes Ryan Raynolds has eleven minutes of screen time maximum actually I liked him a lot and I thought he made a good actor for the dead poor character now hes seen at the beginning that really sold me I mean that was impressive I liked that scene where he had a swords in there and theres bunch of people that are gonna shoot him boom boom boom boom take him down take him down bam bam bam bam bam take that with my magical swords 
hey everyone welcome to Toppers movie review so its Friday January 8 and last week I went and saw Alvin and the chipmunks 2 you know what normally I do a review right after I saw the movie but for this one I just didnt feel like it um I loved the very first Alvin and the chipmunks movie because it had a real nostalgic feel to it it reminded me of getting up on a Saturday morning and eating fruit loops and um watching cartoons but you know for this one I just didnt care um I saw no reason why they needed to bring back the villain from the first one and um while the trailer made the film look real nice and cute it was just flat um Im sure kids are gonna love it kids are gonna love the film I mean its a its a you know CGI Chipmunk movie and they sing and they play songs from todays top ten but for me I was just a little bored sure there were cute money parts in the mixting of the film but otherwise I dont know I didnt even care for it but you go check it out and you let me know what you 
HiIm OliviaUm this is my New Moon review So first of all Im not a xxxI have read the books um and I thought they were average Lets face it they are really not master pieces I thought Twilight directed by Catherine Hardwicke was actually really rather enjoyable um I mean obviously it had its flaws but cinematicly I thought it was good quite good It wasit was enjoyable I wasnt thinking on hearing that Chris Weitz was gonna start the New Moon because of the destruction that was Phillip Pullman the Golden Compass I thought that film was awful and I I didint really know what to expect from New Moon um in terms of his direction Overall New Moon was it was OK just average the thing is its a very good translation of the book Its very very loyal to the book and I really appreciate that loyalty um however it is this loyalty to the original source that gives it its flaws Because people have read the book to understand what was going on And the book is not necessarily the most thrilling book ever I mean the entire xxx is Bella Swan Kristen Kristens Stewards character mobbing around completely depressed It wasnt really the best the most thrilling read ever Ill say that So overallNew Moon even with the bigger better budgets huh it was still too long the angsty too angsty moments withdrawn out to the max as far as thay can go and the script it left all the key plots and emotion from the characters to be exposed through dialogue I think it was Empire magazines review of New Moon that said that Kristen relied heavily on the tactic of tactic of blinking a lot which she really does do a lot but at the same goes for Rob Pattinson as Edward and Taylor Lautner as Jacob they do a lot of frowning Im a manly man and I frown For the moment in this the whole cinema was laughting and you knew you shouldnt be laughing My favorite scene would definately be the Volturi um then my wins on screen wiskers I mean they were really worn in a lots which is a shame because I thought xxx really rather good and um Michael Sheen as Aro as well he was rather enjoyable to watch And I think the Volturi that was my exciting bit of the entire film The rest of the film was just watching Kristen just mob around and that was really boring See I said it was a really rushed review I mean Im really busy at the moment um so I hope they have got more videos coming up seeing but yes 
hey welcome to stuffwelikecom video review of the Green Lantern stuff we like before I went in to see the Green Lantern Ive been hearing all these like critics basically just trashing this movie left and right I wasnt entirely sure why exactly I didnt read what they had written about the Green lantern and what they overall their thoughts were on this movie and still I I Ive yet to as of this review but I at the same time I do wanna just say that I enjoyed this movie I enjoyed it for what it was you know its a huge sort of spectacle movie that is great for this summer time you know this is a movie that youre gonna go out and see and you wanna see it in 3D because I I would actually say this probably is one of the first movies this year that Ive seen this year that you wanna see in 3D especially for just the opening portion it looks really good and the rest of it does look good as well and I just had fun watching this movie its not like a dark movie or anything its very much a light hearted so its perfect for kids as well as just like teenagers as well who just wanna see a lot of explosions and some crazy stuff and you know going into it or these watching the trailers before head I was really kind of hesitant about seeing the Green lantern in the first place because it looks like a cartoon Im not really a huge fan of having like all these 3D characters because I think why not just make this you know movie this live action movie and talk cartoon thats really the route that youre gonna go and it seemed like they were gonna go that route but I think there was also some sort of like um tone within the actual um powers of the green lantern and himself and that you can basically think up of anything and you can project that into the real life and I think having this sort of superpower almost this power to just imagine anything kind of just um helped me get passed that you know these are all CGI characters and set this is a playground and their imaginary playground and anything can happen anything that what also made the film exciting because you dont entirely know whats coming next the entire movie is about building up towards this ultimate battle of this force that is so powerful and they dont even know how to defeat it its that powerful you know its the darkest force ever right but then you kind of like walk out of the movie and youre like well I I get what happened I understand what happened but what what would you do for Green Lantern movie 2 that would be even like worth while now because I mean if hes able to do all of this sort of stuff like how youre supposed to really put up a force that can push him to the next level or or destroy him at the same time during the credit sequence they do have a scene that basically explains what potentially speaking the Green lantern 2 might be about and it does kind of a lea helps alleviate what that whole was is about fighting the ultimate enemy within this first movie and that the threat is still there potentially speaking so its kind of interesting to see um where theyre gonna be going with that Im looking forward to it Ive got to say its not like the Green lantern is the next Batman begins or or the Dark nighter 
much say that I really enjoyed Cowboys and Aliens There was a lot of fun You guys dont know what youre gonna go and see when you go walk into the movie called Cowboys and Aliens If youre expecting some artsy serious Oscar contender than youre wrong The only Oscar that I can even thing of is maybe like best cinematography Because the cinematography in this movie is great and maybe best visual effects coz the visual effects are pretty cool But again you you cant expect a huge like surreal mind bender from the movie called Cowboys and Aliens yo youre gonna see cowboys fighting aliens and you get it here and its satisfactory The action is really intense which surprised me I didnt expect the action to be so intense Theres some really intense action scenes especially the scene when the aliens first invade That scene is like crazy It gave me chills i its a lot of fun the action is really cool The aliens are really cool OK Im not gonna spoil what they look like one thing I like with the aliens is that a they are not just weak links that hide behind the technology They are huge theyre really strong and theyre kind of scary looking I didnt expect that and also I like how its kind of upfront to show them to us instead of hiding them like showing a little like an arm on scene or something no they just straight up show it to us And I really enjoyed that I it was really cool when they did that coz the aliens were really cool looking Daniel Craig does a very good job here He kind of channels the man with no name Clint Eastwood and a lot of people have been saying that I think he does a great job at what he does Hes a really bad ass is really really hard core He doesnt take crap from anybody and he does a really good job Also his innocent accent is pretty convincing Harrison Ford is also good Hes he gives an entertaining performance as the kind of like the leader the of the town hes like an outlaw leader but everyones kind of afraid of him and he at first hes just kind of like grumpy old guy but he becomes more likeable his guts developed more as more likeable character so you can care about him and alsoum Olivia Wild shes pretty good shes beautiful and shes not a bad actor shes actually pretty good Shes in everything nowadays Dont flaw There are some flaws here and there but theyre not huge glaring flaws but they are noticable flaws Such as sometimes the aliens in the western setting do look a little goofy but I was kind of expecting that um theres a plot twist Im not gonna reveal I wasnt a huge fan of it I just thought it was kind of stupid and sometimes it kind of veers into cliche action movie territory like a movie called Cowboys and Aliens a lot of people would think would be kind of like crazy but sometimes it just veers entirely cliche action movie territory again not a huge flaw but its there and its noticable Overall I really enjoyed Cowboys and Aliens and Im gonna give it an eight out of ten It was really fun a very good time and I definately recommend you check it out in theaters coz thats th 
 Oh this quality is horrible Ok well anyhow um This is xxx xxx and I just wanted to do a review of the movie Hanna coz I just watched it today with my family oh and BTW Happy Easter Ok Anyhow Hanna is basicaly about um I dont wanna give it away but basicaly this girl husband trained her whole life to fight and just be prepared for whats out there and trying to get her Anyhow It was really good thay did they didnt really do a whole bunch of background info on why she has to fight and be prepared I mean they did a little bit of it but not a whole bunch and they shouldve I guess they shouldve live up with more and xxx but besides that it was all over pretty good and there is like someone while someone there was a lot of action oh my god a lot of action there is sad part a lot of sad parts but it was really really awesome um well Ok so hanna she goes with this family and shes with this family and Im not gonna say why but the daughter of the family she wants to take her she wants to go on this date but in order to go on the date she need another date so she takes Hanna with her and Hanna being away from civilization as long as she has been she doesnt really know shes so her and the boy that shes on date with theyre just kind of sitting on the bench and theyre just like look away from each other look at each other look away look away than he gets closer and shes like are we suppose to kiss now and hes like um do you want to and shes like then she starts like puckering up whatever he comes in closer and then she grabbed like like shes gonna hold a thing so she can snap his like nack anytime and hes like down on the ground shes just totally tackled him and its a really funny and then the girl the girl from the family not Hanna comes up with the the the other boy and shes like Hanna 
 Moli Elfman coming to you with the review for Red State probably one of the ballsiest probably one of the ballsiest fims od Sundance 2011 Um as really the best way to describe this film is its big its bold its strong it makes big powerfuls statements it doesnt hold back everything from the way its being released to the performances and to the story itself is absolutely ovrt the top impressive and really well done Its a huge break through for Kevin Smith Its completely different from anything weve ever seen him do before John Goodman absolutely amazing Melissa Leo will have you creeped out to your inner core with her tiny little smile Its so well done For all of those people who are hating on it I dont know what they are complaining about it Its a horror film ia a true sense and it is absolutely horrifying Um it is it is definately one of those films thats not gonna be easy for you to find Its being released in a very interesting way Whenever it comes to your town do not miss it Its extremly well made its extremly dare I say fun to watch in a really messed up kind of way and even now its a horror film its definately got some fun Kevin Smith moments in it for you to laugh with um Yeap absolutely not to be missed 
Hey guys the first film I wanted to talk about is the new Winnie the Pooh movie It came out a couple of weeks ago a went to see it just because as a little kid my parents would would show me the many adventures of Winnie the Pooh and those little um that film came out in 1977 and it was a Vignette various Pooh adventures based on the books um and I never went to see Tiggers big move or Piglets big move in a Tigger movie and Pooh and a Heffalumps or whatever the other film was in the early 2000s but I went to this one coz when I saw the trailer it remainded me of the original film and and so I was kind of curious to see maybe if that was what Disney was going for and it definately was what thay were going for um I havent seen the 1977th film Vignettes for a while but I bet if you put them next to the new film that the style would be similar enough that you wouldnt be able to really tell what the difference is um its its great if you remember that was old films would be great for kids too the story is pretty simple weve got great jokes um funny jokes that the kids would get um I love the scene where Eeyore and Pooh think that Owl is getting sick because he says issue and they think he is saying at you um that was probably part of the trailer that got me to go and see the movie beacuse I wanted to see how they could frame that so um if you havent seen Winnie the Pooh and you like family films go see it Its a great one I definately recommend it So more next time See ya 
 Hi everybody my name is Anthony Aranda from Kids first I just got finished watching an excellent movie called Mars Needs Moms This movie is all about Milo who goes on a big adventure to help his mother to get away from the alians And the alians arent really good mothers so thats why they looked down on at Earth to find good mothers to take care of the alian siblings And my favorite characters in the movie would have to be Milo Milos mother and Gribble I liked Gribble because he helped Milo get Milos mother away from the alians Which I thought was awesome And my favorite part in the movie was when Milo has to save Gribble Because the alians in the uniforms were gonna shoot Gribble And when they were about to shoot Gribble Milo came in swung in and then saved the day And the there are some bad people in this movie and that is the alians and the uniforms They are bad because they listen to the Supervisor The Supervisor wants everything around here She dosent care about enything enyone ever says And I would recommend this movie for ages 3 and up because it is a good movie and it depends what age you are and how you to how you feel like see the movie Like for example my brother is five years old and he didnt think this movie was scary at all I am eight years old and I thought it was really s kind of scary And that was my example And I think I why I would be scared is because I would feel scared and kind of sad if I lost my own mother But it all turns out great in the end Go out and see this movie when it premiers on Disney DVD Oops it looks I got done Bye 
music all right I just watched the Watchman yes I was watching the Watchman um lets see it was a few words describe it um graphics were incredible um some really good acting some really sucky acting um blue penis youre like what what did you just say um yeah blue penis all right let me explain OK um the guy thats blue in the movie Dr Manhattan um hes naked so this was pretty funny coz people were like eating popcorn and you see the first show and people you hear like this this ripple effect of whispering oh my god is that a is that am I looking at this right what I thought that was really funny um there couldve been less blue nudity because what was weird was the fact that in part of the movie hes wearing like a blue um overall flong thing medal flong thing so I was like why not wear the whole whole time you know why why you got to go command on us it was funny though hes funny um theres other nudity in it it was like people that arent blue um thats all right I dont know its kind of weird naked up on spaceship I dont know classic superhero kind of getting on kind of thing all right so enough of the nudity lets hear about the story lets talk about the acting um but what sucked what was bad was Malin Akerman the girl who plays the Silk Spectre II um junior lady girl I know I I mean she looked fan fantastic she looked phenomenal she looked like a superhero but she acted like power ranger and theres a vast difference between those two things but Ill tell you what Ill tell you who made the movie who was just kick ass 100 of time was the guy that played our Rorschach I dont know if Im saying that right Rorschach ror Rorschach I think it is a Rorschach but anyways he was awesome hes the little guy with the white mask and implants on it that change all the time I thought that was very cool um he was awesome like he was incredible the other guy that did a really good job was um Jeffrey Dean Morgan the guy who played the comedian he did a very good job very dark um I really liked sicko guy but um he did a really good job at acting I was very impressed so overall its its like a blend of youve got alternative history youve got multi multiple different time periods mixed together um but different genres and its very very interesting um but its extremely dark I warn you its a very very dark and um theres not in my opinion there wasnt very much of a balance between sort of like the good evil kind of thing and it seemed like everything was sort of overwhelmingly bad um so at the end theres not really a whole lot of redeeming value that I think you come up with but um you know overall it was good I have to say 
reaveal one it now um Im gonna give the reasons why I like him but mostly Im gonna give the reasons of why I dont think hes gonna be a classic in the same way as the first movie Predator or Aliens um which I think Rodrigez was going for he th th he always said that he was gonna do the sequel um he wanted this to be um th the Predator equivalent of aliens um as um you know as aliens was to alien um and Im gonna really point out why that I dont think he really pulled he pulled that off um why was a mistake really to try and do that um but I did enjoy it so um Im gonna point out the stuff I did like there were some action scenes in it um the characters were well developed um not all of the characters but um I would say that um there was theres good there were four good characters in there um I I liked agent Brodys character I thought he was um well developed you know well drawn out character someone you cared about I liked the girl who was the Israeli sniper I thought she was the number one well drawn character um I liked the Russian guy Juri I think his name was um you cared you there was enough in there for you to care about him and xxx was an interesting character um he had some funny he had a few one lines that was quite quite funny yeah once unfortunately um I think in the writing somewhere they they just werent um developed enough fear to care about them um and that includes is it Topher Graces I think I think his name was includs his character um I just didnt think it was well developed enough and um I also I I include in that Laurence Fishburnes character as well who I think Rodrigez when he wrote the mo wrote the movie was going for a Marlon Brando apocalipse now type of character but he actually found um when hes seen come up it slowed the movie down um and this is the problem um with Predator to Predators compared to Predator Predator is really well paced movie and it picks up speed and never lets go ev even in the same xxx where they they slow you know they meant to have some dialogue and and talk about whats going on yo you know it felt the movie slowed down wheres it in the middle of this when when they they with um Laurence Fishburne character it does slow down a great deal I didnt really feel um the inclusion of his charater was necessary um it couldve been written out I know he was there to um give out the main characters some information on who these new Pre Predators are and what theyre about but um 
 hey hows it going guys I went to go see the Adjustment Bureau Friday so I thought Id give you guys a review for those of you who may have not seen it and maybe wished to see it right just as a little synopsis the main character played by Matt Damon he falls in love with the girl in a bathroom which is where all great relationships should start um you know these two people fall in love with each other but theres this higher organization called the adjustment bureau and they try to adjust adjust their lives each other persons life to keep them away from each other because that what it says in the plan this plan that they are following so Matt Damon um desides not to do that and he wants to live with the girl anyways and so you know hes trying to run away from the adjustment bureau and theyre theyre chasing him and theres running theres a lot of doors opening and closing and theres fedoras and just its very its very chaotic at the end of this movie I literally said out loud what que what is this movie that I am seeing what is this I do not understand this movie but theres a reason for that theres a reason for why I was confused first off the commercial makes the terrible terrible mistake of saying that it is more thought provoking than Inception thanks a lot commercial the entire time I was constantly comparing it to Inception but I must say those are some pretty big shoes to fill so I thought maybe it has a chance I I should give it a shot you know I was just waiting for Joseph Gordon Levitt to come out just jump out any time and say its a paradox now the only suspensful part that I found in the first thirty minutes of the movie was when Matt Damon first discovers the Bureau in the first place you know ther theres a lot of confusion theres scuffling he hes trying to run away from them end up catching him and then they explain their purpose to him as to why they are there which kind of just ruins the suspense right there because if youve got some convenient guy in a fedora to just tell you oh yes we are the adjustement bureau and this is what we do you know its just kind of ruins the suspense and now Im not Im not excited anymore interestingly it turned out to be more of a romantic comedy than it was a thriller um you know it had some interesting writing you know it was it was funny at times Matt Damon is a you know hes a pretty funny guy but just aside from that they really dropped the ball on the suspensful parts overall overall it had far too many plot holes and just not enough depth to be interesting I have to say my favorite character in the entire movie is the character Thompson if you go see the movie youll see him but hes just the creepiest old guy youll ever see in your life he stands over people when theyre asleep just staring at them just imagine if youre in your bed sleeping and getting your dream on whatever you do you know and theres just someone standing at the foot of your bed just 
the instant watch and um I have to admit I was watching this I purposly put it on because I figured it would be something that would be stupid that I could fall asleep in the middle of and not miss too much coz it was late at night I was tired just wanted something to watch while I was falling asleep so I didnt didnt have very high expectations for this movie and I um pretty much it pretty much met my low expectations for the most part because I three major complaints I have about this movie um biggest one is the CGI effects were just terrible and um the story was pretty weird um and again I I if I had to pay closer attention I might have followed it more and might have been it might have made more sense um um this movie this movie um by half way through I was checking the time and saw that this movie was two hours long which I mean for a movie about JI Joe ninty minutes is enough Ok I dont need a three hour mini xxx about JI Joe but thats just me I thought that two hours was way too long for this movie and the last big thing was um just the the it it I know its about JIJOe you know obviously its gonna be about the army but it just felt like um like um military propaganda kind of like you know it fell like I was watching one of those army of one commercials sometimes um um but I can understand that I mean its about the army even if its a um you know fantacy version of the army of course its too much of course its gonna be making them look good just fine I I guess um but the funny thing is um I mean funny thing is despite as despite everything bad about this movie I ended up half way liking it and thats because about half way through the movie I realized that this is just its really just a cartoon if you look at it as a live action movie you youre gonna be disappointed but if you look at it as a cartoon which is pretty much mostly is with all the CGI FX and and there is a lot of it I mean this movie makes um makes um Star wars pretty close I mean its its about that level star war is pretty close as far as just CGI heavy like this time its what its like human face and everything around that face is cartoon CGI computer effects 
 hi the Smurfs are back and in 3D I like this movie at first I thought the movie would appeal more to younger audience but I actually found myself enjoying the movie and laughing if you havent seen the Smurfs TV series the movie is about how a group of little blue people come to New York after trying to escape from the evil Gargamel they befriend a couple named Patrick and Grace since they let them stay at their appartment if youre wondering how the Smurfs will avoid Gargamel and get back to their magical world watch the movie to find out I think the movie really depicted the liveliness of New York City while since Im a New Yorker myself I also liked how the storyline of the movie worked together smoothly the movie also delivers many meaningful messages the Smurfs learn the importance of team work and Patrick learns to believe in himself and follow his heart I also thought some parts of the movie were funny for example um Gargamels cat facial expressions theyre so hilarious and similar to xxx person with that I recommend this film to children six and up it is a fun family film parents will find themselves laughing as they reminisce they childhood and children will like the movie since the Smurfs are so adorable and they go on thrilling adventures this has been a review from Gabriela Choo for Kids first bye 
 hey internet I saw Despicable me last night in XD or real D 3D however you wanna call it this movie is adorable the plot of Despicable me follows Gru an evil villain who has kind of being slipping as he gets older only able to pull off minor highs and steals and hes getting showing up by um bigger and newer villains so his next plan is to steal the Moon unfortunatelly a new evil nemesis has stolen the shrink ray which he needs to steal the Moon so Gru uses or adopts three little girls to help infiltrate his nemesiss fortress to steal the shrink ray the plan gets side tracked when Gru actually starts caring about these youngsters as more than just part of his evil plot this movie is just too adorable there were some really good things about this movie the voice acting excellent the visuals were great this was probably the best 3D movie Ive seen in a long time coz it actually used 3D Toy Story had elements of it but this movie played with 3D and um different ways to come at you out of the screen so I liked that a lot the voice acting in this was incredible Steve Carell voices Gru and Russell Brand actually really impressed me with his old man voice for the doctor of I couldnt I couldnt even believe it was Russell Brand I kept I was listening bored and there was maybe one time when I thought I actually heard Russell Brand himself but otherwise I thought he was excellent as for 3D I say yes theres one scene in this movie that makes 3D entirely worth it and thats when theyre in the amusement park and some people might think that theres a lot of cheap tricks but theres a roller coaster scene and if you are um get a little bit motion sick you might not wanna see it in 3D because youll feel like youre on this coaster I mean my stomach was almost going wohu as we went down the big drop I thought it was really cool that was a great effect there was a lot of cheap child humour which everyone can relate to and I I always think thats hilarious but what made this movie really fun was some of the adult humour jabs for instance semispoiler when Gru goes into the bank and the evil part of the bank to get a loan 
 Ok so tonight I went and saw the movie Crazy stupid love or what I would like to call Rayan Gosling leather shoe and suit porn Now before I get in to the movie review which as you guys all know is mostly xxx talking about movie review but I actually really FUCKING love this movie So theres not gonna be any of bad shit But before a I talk about the movie I wanna talk about a preview very quickly So there was a movie out and it stared every mother fucker in Hollywood Now automatically goes like oh VALENTINES DAY no New Years fucking eve WHAT are they doing with those stupid cliche movies about love revolving around holidays And they always pick stupid ass holidays Whats next Thanksgiving afternoon fucking Harbor day fucking Flag day Why do they keep making those stupid movies with every mother fucker thats in Hollywood and are always crappy and Im just sitting up here like God damn it I would only see this movie for xxx xxx so anyway the movie was really fucking awesome I think that that they personally thought that Rachel Withers really fucking love suits and Ryan Gosling so they made this movie with me in mind Like Im dead fucking serious No really like Rachel Whiters needs some fucking fat material they were like fucking Rachel ass waitress loves leather shoes on men Especially men that look like Ryan S Gosling I wish I was Ryan Gosling Ryan Gosling The best part in the movie Im not gonna fucking spoil anything for you just because that would be rude and you should all go out and see it and you know stuff Best part of the fucking ass movie was this one scene where Ryan Gosling was just standing there in a fucking suit eating pizza in slow ass motion that was just like hu like zooming in on him and Im just like sitting here like any mother fuckers drop Emma Stone was in this movie as well and you wouldnt really know it coz she was hardly in it and I was really upset about it coz you know apparently according to people on the internet aka tumbler because everyone on tumbler is on crack they all think I look like her or like sound like her or act like her I dont know I guess we both have like that like mm male sounding voice Like I kind of sound like I might have a penis And yeah I know we both have that like an easy way we both have red hair we both like flooged in shit and its like maybe but like in this movie she had brown hair and she didnt really act like me at all and I was kind of upset about it because like she mustve been an animal and she wasnt and I was thinkin like if I can be mother fucking Emma Stone and Chris can be Royan Gosling and that would be just great didnt really happen in the movie I was kind of upset about that theres a giant ass twist to this movie at the end like Its obviosly not like a serious fucking movie or anything Its comedy romantic romcom raoa Im a little disappointed in myself for not realising the twist before it actually twisted because like what the fuck like thats what Im good at Im gonna spoil skins right now I totally knew Manny and Rick were gonna be related I fucking knew it like I knew it I knew that inception that they were gonna be dreaming um Im fucking kidding right now So Im gonna go download the soundtrack in like five minutes and Im pretty sure Flee Fox is on it and if its not I just had really bad ears but I kind of thought it was Flee Fox I dont know but it was a realy good movie really good soundtrack and if you really really like Ryan Gosling and fucking like 
hi youre watching Watch this fucking movie My name is Jenn and I will be reviewing Never let me go for you today so today is the day of the Oscars and I was just thinking about all the nominees and um particularly the movies that I feel like shouldve gotten nominated but didnt and Never let me go is actually one of those movies I saw Never let me go a while back actually so its not completely fresh in my mind but I do remember a lot of it and I do remember um what I thought about it I think a lot of people are really split about this movie theres a certain deadpan nature to it it was a pretty slow movie for the most part and it was it was thoughful but there are you know therere critics of movies that are sometimes too thoughful in a way and I think that would never let me go a lot of critics said that it relied too much on the audience to um explore the themes in the film and you know tightly so I guess which um in a way a lot of the themes in Never Let me go which were very profound and deep they werent fully explored and I think that the movie did rely on you to kind of figure it out and kind of deal with those ideas by yourself but regardless I thought it was a very good movie the story surrounds threee main characters two boys and one I mean two girls and one boy sorry but two girls are played by Carey Mulligan and Keira and Keira Knightley and the boy is played by Andrew Garfield those three are some of the best young actors of today Carey Mulligan I mean shes been in an Education she and everything she does she has so much grace to it and so much fluidity and Keira Knightley I mean everybody knows her from the Pirates of the Carribean but I mean in her other works like Pride and Prejudice shes just been realy fantastic and Andrew Garfield of course everybody knows him form the Social Network and hes also going to be the new Spiderman so look out for that that should be interesting but anyways they did um they did act very well and again the story surrounds these three kids and theyre growing up in the boarding school and you dont exactly know what is going on I think it takes place sometime um its I dont think its present day but its um its someone modern I would say its not its not like a period piece or anything but um these three kids and you see them as children they are growing up in a boarding school and you dont exactly know whats going on theres something off about the boarding school theyre the children are told that their health is supposed to be paramount and that above all things that they should be healthy and that sort of becomes the theme throughout their whole childhood it is just taking care of themselves and preparing themselves to go out into that outside world and I think early on the twist is revealed Never let me go is actually based on a novel and if youve read the novel and I 
snap Hey everybody um so today Im going to be reviewing I am number four the movie I have already reviewed the book and if you have not seen a video please check it out because I can always use the views so yeah if you havent seen the movie or read the book I am number four is xxx about a a species of alians called Lorians who have escaped to Earth because their planet was invaded by the Mogadorians another spicies of alians um There are only a handful Lorians left like maybe like nine children and their guardians called Sequin and Dundel Mogadorians have Folden too Hard to track them down and and isolate them But to make it harder for them the Lornians place a charm on their children so thay can always be killed in a certain order and um we in the movie The main character is number four who goes by the name of John Smith and for John the stake has been raised because number three just died hes next so he and his sequin Henry xxx tehy settle in a small town called Paradise Ohio which is where our story takes place um So there are things that I liked about the movie better than I liked about the book and vice verse It wasnt like It wasnt like oh the book was so much harder than movie maybe because number four was not my all time favorite book it was a good book but but um I wasnt crazy about it so yeah and the movie was pretty good in my opinion so I liked the movie because it did a good job of explaining the back story in the book good job of explaining thing with Lorain the Mogadorians the numbers they and they kind of stuck to the book of it so I like that and but xxx were too Hollywood for me like th this thing isnt really a big deal but um I I ddint like the fact that John had an iphone because think about it if you if your top priority is survival than why would you be worried about having the latest technology you know what I mean So since were not really sure what their financial situation is they could be like scraping by or they could be totally rich but my opinin like he shouldnt have an iphone he shouldnt care about the latest trends so thats really what the lieutenant xxx I thought it was all too commercial in that aspect um Like I said it wasnt big deal and you probably dont think so but you know just one of those little things that that hurt you for some reason you know what I mean um another thing that did bother me were the kissings um John does meet a girl in paradise and in some hearts like tr l 
 Before I get to the substance of my review Id like to clear up a couple of things First the fact that Im wearing on of my new Marvell geek shirts as Im giving this review is a coincidence and secondly Im going to throw out the spoiler alert I cant express my thoughts and feelings about this movie adequatly without describing some specific things in the third act of the movie which is spoilerific so so if you havent seen the movie and you stick it out through this entire movie video and I end ups saying something that ruins it for you youve been warned Now to the subject of this review Green Lantern starring Ryan Reynolds Blake Lively Peter Sarsgaard Mark Strong among others this was a big event for DC and for Warner Brothers and for superhero fans everywhere Big for Warner Brother because it had a huge production budget and was potentially seen um as the first step of a series of xxx towards justice league movie It was widely believed that a sucess of Green Lantern movie would lead Warner Brothers to adapt the Flash and Wonder woman among possibly others and put them in a justice leage movie with the ritual Batman and Superman So not only that this movie have to deal with the burden of telling its own selfcontained story and setting up its own inevitable sequels it had to deal with the expectations of potentially setting up all that others stuff And how did it do Yeah not good to all the green lantern fans out there I am so sorry I say that for two reasons First because someone owes you an appologie and Warner Brothers is never gonna give you one And secondly because as a Marvell geek I have experienced my fair share of disappointments over the last decade and I can genuinly symphatize with you Before I get to the negatives of the movie let me list off a few of the positives i love Jeffrey Rush and Michael Clarke Duncan as the voice actors They do a great job with their roles They are great additions I also love the casting of Mark Strong as Sinestro Hes perfect for that role and um finally a particular stand out scene for me was the fighter jet sequence It was by far my favorite action seen in the movie I thought it was really well put together and um I thought it worked worked pretty well Um and in fact in spite of all the negatives Im about to mention I thought the movie was working for a while for about the first third um but at the end of act one two significant things happened Hactor Hummand arrives and starts chewing scenery like its a two dollar steak and how Jordan flies off to the green lantern core planet oh and the movie starts sequel baiting These two developments together caused what was up to that point a noble effort to start falling apart at the seams and it was painful to watch I dont even know why I really should begin with listing off the negatives but Im going to start with a few of the superficial things The acting ranges from mediocrity to hamfisted from the live action actors but I cant really blame them for that because a few of them are acting for entire sequences entire lantern for green screens This is Star Wars prequal territory The acting is not that bad but still its that kind of movie making and and you know I wasnt expecting good acting out of 
hey obviously this is my review of Sucker Punch Sucker Punch is the new Zack Snyder action film starring Emily Browning Abbie Cornish Jena Malone Vanessa Hudgens and Jamie Chung the film follows Baby doll whos been locked away in a mental hospital in Vermont with the team of young misfits baby doll unlocks her mind to try and escape the hospital before shes lobotamized browning is institutionalized in this hospital after a mishap of her accidentally killing her sister this mental hospital isnt even a mental hospital it is a horror house browning is told by her instructor doctor Gorski to you know let go and dance for these men who can also be considered the pimps in this situation in doing so she acesses this fantasy world inside of her mind which ends up being this huge court of moral come back kind of thing where she ends up just kicking everybodys ass they are led by the wise man who is Scott Glenn and of course the antagonist to I believe in this case is Blue whos played by Oscar Isaak realizes of course that they are up to something mischiveous baby doll ends up convincing Sweet pea Rocket you know Blondie and Amber who are you know these all who are these misfits um to go into this little dream world with her um and you know like steal these items that will um eventually lead to their escape Sucker punch stars Emily Browning as Baby doll the innocent looking protagonist Browning is mediocre role theres never a feeling of star quality with her she isnt terrible but quite frankly she is implausible Browning has starred in you know those other films like the average horror film the Uninvited and visually stunning and I dont know why people are hating on the film because I really do love it xxx is a series of unfortunate events overall Browning is just fails to deliver and is upstaged by many other performances in the film the supporting cast is either hit or miss the hits include Oscar Isaak as the main villain like I said Blue Jena Malone is the soft spoken Rocket and the stealing Abby Cornish is Sweet pea a troubled and reluctant young woman in the pack the misses include you know Vanessa Hudgens who doesnt have any presents or greatness at all and the other horrible I mean absolutely atrocious Carla Gugino as doctor Vera Gorski whos accent is so aweful and whos is ridiculous and her character is also undeveloped and weak Jon Hamm and Scott Glenn could bring you know they could be interesting characters and they could have great back stories but they you know they they bring nothing to this table and which hurts the film drastically because they are interesting characters and could have interesting back stories the acting could be better and is very medio there is some sort of greatness to Sucker punch though first the visual effects here are stellar they are unique incredible icandy and just overall superb and the action in the movie is so well used but when the action is used in Sucker Punch its ultimately the gr 
 hello everyone xxx for another review and before I start look at this haircut I got yes very new I got it today I hope you like it I do Very well the review today is for the movie where people were dying in 3D for your personal enjoyment and the series that died violently two years ago oh I mean the Final Destination or you can call it the Final Destination 3D dont forget that the people now the Final Destination is the forth film in entire series and the plan here is by the basics folks group of people go to Ness corvette one of them has a vision where a disaster happens and all of them were gonna die he she forces them to leave the event where the disaster than takes placeThe survivors than die one by one in a freek accident with the viewer supposed to believe that death is following them its bad oh God this is bad now this is not gonna be a rat so if you think this is gonna be a huge rat review no its not even worth it Im not even gonna go to the lows to make a whole night video about this movie so no now know this I am not a fan of the Final Destination series I hate it I might have to watch the first two again or maybe just the first one to stabilize my thoughts on the series but as far as Im concerned this series is garbage You can sense my excitement when I heard this was being released Now I wont even talk about acting coz its just so bad Its a joke really Now let just get into two things that will possibly attract you to this film the violence and the 3D viewers please resist from these two the violence here is pretty bad Therere about two creative scenes in here um one being in intestinal journey through the rectum in a swimming pool drain and a tire decapitation that the tire decapitation might not sound all that unique but the way its pulled off its like wow that was sick I mean not the sick like oh my God that was awesome no sick in the oh my god that was crazy that kind of sick theres many different ways of saying sick nowadays but um yeah wow agh say that in two shee two scenes death isnt even nearly unique is a bit harsh the race stadium scene and the mall scenes in the beginning and the end where massive amounts of people die in the craziest ways are pretty good for late night buddy viewing you see you know what I mean by late night buddy viewings If you dont than come on peop 
 Lets talk Sex and the City 2 snap Most of the critics are right It just really heh but if you loved the series and you also liked xxx the first movie than youre still gonna have fun just go in with low expectaions If your pet pees Carrie wore those horrendous hideous hats they were not catching the ball and a few times I didnt like the fashion A few times I thought that was bumped way over the top and they kind of looked like clowns The desert scene was one of them um but you know the premise is OK and there are a few nice moments The movie is really too long they shouldve just cut the wedding in the beginning its not even necessary for the plot I also thought that desert riding the camels all troup stopped looking like clowns But also not necessary but I love the moment with Charlotte in the closet because who hasnt experienced that although I ran to the bathroom and um It was just fun to see your old friends again so if your a fan Id do it but dont expect much the writing isnt as good as the first the storyline isnt this good but if you dont expect a lot I think youll enjoy it And thats it Now off to bed 
 Hello friends Im doing another movie review last night a group of friends and myself went to go see the Green Hornet and it was actually pretty good um I was expecting Seth Rogan to be a little bit more serious in this movie but he wasnt He was the same old goofy Seth Rogan that we all know um but IT was still a good film um I think that I mean I had fun with it So to me thats a pretty good movie um um I am a little familiar with the Green Hornet um Ive read some of the comics and um because of that I was expecting Seth Rogan to maybe try to be a little bit more serious but he wasnt But you know thats OK I guess um I still had fun with it um the car the black beauty that was amazing all the guns even the car over there that was really sweet And all the action scenes were great the special effects were great and the guy who played Kato whose first name is J The actors name is J J something um he was good he played Kato perfectly and he did a great job um The acting was was pretty good and the action was good um I would definatelly recommend you go see it in theaters coz take a bunch of your friends because you you guys will have a good time Youll have fun and youll laugh it is funny its a funny movie Lots of Lots of laugh out loud moment I guess you could say but um Yeah go check it out Its one its one to check out in theaters I would say um snif but yeah so the Green Hornet it was OK I expected a little bit more seriousness but It was still good It get it gets pretty serious and um fun at the end too pretty intense at the end so thats my review so Thats it yeah Im gonna turn this off 
Im a big fan of the first Tron Um i thought this is the perfect time to have a Tron sequel because um in at the beginning of the 1980s people thought that computers can do every every anything and everything and now technology actually does anything and everything because it kinda controls our lives so it was the perfect time for a Tron sequel unfortunately um the writers and I were not exactly on the same wavelength lip smacking but I will say that the first third of this movie is amazing its the best summer movie Ive seen all year but you know the pacing is so good it gets straight into the story you have lots of uh references to the first movie you know you have recurring characters you have new characters that actually have a connection to the old ones and once Sam Flynn enters the grid you know the soundtrack draws you in the special effects look amazing uh they dont waste a lot of time on exposition because the minute the soundplane enters the grid he is put in the games and let me tell you the games look great all those action sequences in involving the games were great to watch um the cho the choreography of the fights the special effects I was so happy to be back in the grid that I wasnt really thinking about the story or where the story was going but then sam flynn meets his father and Tron basically turns into a star wars prequel after that one disconnection then that happens at that point because uh the old flynn the original flynn starts going on and on about these kinds of aliens not aliens artifical intelligence i guess that he found on the grid and he just pulls them the writers just pull this out of their ass and the whole movie becomes about these crazy i i isos theyre calles ISOs and its just like or why do we need these things it doesnt make any sense because anyway they get purged at some point because when the old Flynn finds these things whatever they are theyre so wise and naive kinda like Navi now that I think about it clue which is the program that he created in the first movie kinda pulls a bunny in the boiler moment in the sense that he turns into a crazy jealous psycho stalker bitch and clue has to be one of the most idiotic villains ever cause what is a what is clue clue is a computer program and he wants to take all the programs that are now under his control and put them in the real world for some kind of freaky teleportation or whatever so basically you have this computer program that wants to create a physical army on the planet and its like youre a computer program okay if you want to take over the world using real people its the worst way you could possibly do that infiltrate some computer system somewhere and detonate some nukes or something 
 Hey guys its Bree and today Im gonna talk to you about The Expendables So last night I decided to watch the Expendables at midnight and I was unbelievably shocked how much I loved it It was full of action great dialogue the characters were so great and well developed Its really just a heart warming story Its a great movie to see over and over again your whole family can see it Its not that violent xxx it is a teenytiny bit violent and not enough so you can bring your 5 year old I really realy felt for the dad in the Expendables because he was protecting over his family and after they went missing even though theyre a bend of outsiders and thay have all those powers the dad was just really protective and he made sure that hes whole family was safe Very heart warming very touching Brad Bird is a great writer and director He wrote and directed Ratatouille and the Iron Giant um I think that my favorite part of the entire movie was when you find out at the end that the little baby had powers It was so cute just the great great movie I really recommend you all see the Expendables My boyfriend got really excited when I told him we were gonna go see the Expandables and than um when I went to blockbuster and I picked it up and I brought it back home he got really disappointed I think its because it was such a moving film and I dont think he knows how to handle his emotions in that department so it was just a little awkward but um weve overcome that You know a lot of people have been talking about the Expendables even though it came out such a long time agao theres been a lot of buzz about it lately and everyones you know a lot of controversy over it Everyones been saying its really intense I can see that There are parts that are very intense but for the most part it is a family friendly warm and fuzzy movievoovie So go see the Expendables I know you guys are gonna love it Stay tuned guys I have many more movies to go in through 
Silvester Stalone produced by Silvester Stalone starring Silvester Stalone directed by Silvester Stalone so yeah Silvester Stalone so its gonna be an action movie obviously and you you guys all know what the Expendables are and if you dont basically slice of the memo to all the action stars for the last twenty years and say hay show up for this movie so most of them dead and its really what you wouldve expact its not a compelling narrative by any means theres little to no character development all movie and yet this movie is incredibly enjoyable for action fans um start off kind of like who the charcters are um Silvester Stalone obviously is the lead character and he leads this troop of mercenaries called the Expendables and really theres no humongous tale to these guys just a bunch of army mercs who now make a living taking jobs um this movie just falls among other jobs just like you know the kind of the biggest hadrest job he had yet and essentially they are to take down a tyrant owned in another nation and thats really itjust take down this tyrant not a complicated story but you know what you dont need a complecated formula for an action movie theres a bad guy guy go take him down thats really all you need this movie essentially was made for three reasons in my opinion the first reason is the obvious just to make an exciting enjoyable action film and thats you know all thats all you really needed to do and definatelly comes through on that Ill touch on why in a bit the second reason this movie was made and in my opinion the real reason it was made again its Silvestre Stalone telling himself I still got it um Ive got to give him credit Hes in terrific shape for a man twice my age who looks significantly better than me thats kind of made me feel depressed but hey whatever and is showing yeah maybe hes not what he was twenty twenty five years ago but he still has every right to be billed as an action star theres actually yeah yeah scenes triple stand off with Silvestre Arnold Swarzeneger Bruce Willis and yeah actually in a way kind of fell hollow because you know its basically it was Stalone knowing these guys arent in the shape they were twenty twenty five years ago so hes like hey look I still got it yeah and I dont know if this scene took place fefteen twenty years ago when those guys were absolutely prime it wouldve been just um absolutely breath taking monumental moment in cinematic history but seeing it today now when it was really nothing more than just a one xxx ship it lost a lot of feeling it wasnt the final you know finally happened u uniting that we all come to expect it just it felt kind of cut and dry which would start the planning that I wish it has happened earlier in their careers the third and in my opinion most important reason this movie happened is in a way it felt like it was passing on the tou 
 Hello there you tube Michel xxx again and Im gonna do my Ive decided to do two of reviews in one day since Ive got nothing to do much So here we go the long awaited movie review of Final Destination 3 So here we go Now this movie um re unites the two direct creators of the first movie Jim Vong and Glan Morgan Jim Vong comes to act in the third one again I was very impressed with his work on the first one I thought the first one was creative and inventive and really brought something new to the cinema the second one was direced by David Arales whos also directing the fourth one the Final Destination coming out now whats that again now but the second one it didnt in some ways take to the next level but in some ways the first one was better so it was just about equal to the first one so here we are with the creators of the first one Final Destination 3 So lets get into this review and Ill tell you why what I thought Ill tell you what I thought of it So anyway here we go The plot of the movie this time its basically exactly the same as first two movies but different characters So here we go um Mary Elizabeth Winstead portraits Wendy Christensen and Ryan Merriman portraits Kevin Blake and guess the second name I dont know anyway thats not the review Wendy has a premonition that the roller coaster at her and her friends who are in the amusement park has a the preminition is that the roller coaster is gonna crash which is of course exactly the same as the first two it happenes and it prep it crashes she she and a few people get of the ride and of course what happenes is exactly the same as the first two where um the death starts pickin up people one by one and you know before they reach their Final Destination and they have to try to stay alive and avoid death as much as possible So thats the basic plot of Final Destination 3 now um but some of the brush plot that you mey think I hated this movie but youre wrong actually I did I really liked it Ill tell you why first First Im gonna get into the acting which was much much better than the second one the second one had wooden acting in some places Im sorry I did like the second one but there most of the actors we so witty exeption may be the police cop and Kim Kimberly but the rest of the actors were so wooden They were just theyre just they just why acting what theyre doing anyway I dont know they do seem they need to learn acting better anyway The further I went acting was much much better in the second one anyway Mary Elizabeth Winstead oh my god she is a teriffic shes nice looking as well but she is also a teriffic actress Olso this is one of the best performances Ive ever seen out of hers Ive not seen one bad movie that shes been into I mean this is the only movie Ive actually seen with her in it and Die hard 4 Teriffic in that but Mary Elizabeth Winstead I must say she is a teriffic and beautiful and talented acress She displays the emotional distress of her character so well you actually feel for her character You know shes going through the stress and you feel sorry for her and you wanna help her 
 Cowboys and Aliens metaphoricaly speaking is like one of those NFL teams that has the talent to be a super bowl champion but instead ends up being a wild cart team that just gets dismissed in the first round of playoffs yeah job pretty well done I mean it wasnt a bad year but there was a lot of potential left on the table And that describes Cowboys and Aliens pretty well Though I guess I should be grateful that it turned out as good as it did because given all the strikes that it had going against before wonder production it could have been much much worse Fortunally some good decisions were made before the camara started rolling Jon Favreau was hired to direct and Daniel Craig and Harisson Ford were cast as the lead roles but this probably had the unfortunate side effect of raising bad expectations to unreasonable levels When I saw the first trailer back in November of last year this movie immediately shot up near the top of my list of must see movies for 2011 The final product ultimately doesnt live up to the high order of that first trailer but its still a pretty enjoyable ride if you go in wanting to see a bunch of cowboys battle a bunch of aliens yeah youll pretty much get your fill but if thats all youre looking for youll actually miss the best thing about this movie Jon Favreau is probably not the guy that I would hire if I was looking for a director for an action movie I mean yeah hes a competent action director hes action sequences are certainly a lot better than the incoherent impossible to follow slope that we see in a typical Michael Bay movie but its action isnt particulary memorable I mean lets look at his track record Hes directed three big action movies in the last three years Two Ironman films and now this And the action wasnt the most memorable thing about any on those movies The ironman films are fondly remembered mostly for Robert Doweny Jr Not the action And the same thing has more or less happened here yeah thats right the movie called Cowboys and Aliens Daniel Craig steels the whole damn show hes playing a variation of the iconic man with no name character that was made famous by Clint Eastwood and now that Ive seen him in the role I cant imagine any other current actor trying ot pull it off He is perfect from start to finsih Harisson Ford is a long for the ride and having a blast as the second lead and the cast is pretty well rounded out with suppordting performance from guys like Sam Rockwell as the Doc Theyre all playing cliched stock western characters but I really dont care that the characters are walking cliches when they are this well done and the actors do such a good job of carrying of their particular arcs Cowboys and Aliens problem is the screenplay Six different people got writing credit for this movie and the results are exactly what you would expect the story 
Im here to review Adjustment Bureau and I thought this movie was gonna be really good because matt damon was in it and I was really disappointed so this movies about david norris played by matt damon and what happens is that he is going to run for new york senator and he just cant win because he keeps on making mistakes a lot of mistakes involve stuff that just makes him look bad in the public eye pictures and stuff that he did where the people were like we cant have this guy cause hes not mature enough so now hes preparing his losing speech and he sees a girl in the bathroom and they instantly kiss I dont know they have like they talk for like five minutes and instantly kiss which is dumb but uh she runs away because these cops are chasing her because she crashed a wedding so the next day the adjustment bureau comes in these people that are supposed to change things so that people can have their own fate and the world will be alright now what happens is that matt damon is supposed to spill coffee on himself at exactly 705 but the Adjustment Bureau guy falls asleep and chuckling yeah he forgets to make him spill coffee on himself so he catches the bus and guess who he sees emily blunt so the adjustment bureau is pissed off because the guy that was supposed to make him spill the coffee and make him miss the bus messed up and now he actually knows her and gets her number and everything and theyre not supposed to meet theyre not supposed to fall in love its not part of the plan so matt damon goes to work you know sees his office and everything and sees everybody doesnt even realize that theyre not moving but yea when he opens the door to his boss office he sees that these people are like adjusting his life and hes wondering what the hell is going on and you know they tell him they adjust peoples lives and that they might have to erase his mind completely unless he stays away from the girl and doesnt tell anybody about the plan so matt damon of course does not listen and he still wants to be with the girl so he goes against the adjustment bureau but they keep on changing things on him so it makes it hard for him to be with her so pretty the whole story is about fate des versus free will and which one is more important what i liked about this movie was the concept was cool theres this people t you cant do anything because they are controlling your life pretty much like who you love and all this but they did not execute it very well and they left a lot of plot holes this movie is terrible for these reasons and im gonna tell you why number one because the love is forced you dont feel that these two people love each other and it is very rushed i mean you dont see why these two people love each other theres no character development really with these two like they have their own separate character development but none where these two should be together theres no reason why they should be together you dont see why they should like each other cause they dont show it in the movie i mean the the way they show it is like they ta 
 Hey guys so I just went and saw the Green Hornet oh my gosh bad movie really bad movie I wish I werent because I truly love an action flick action comedy flick even better right oh no So um Im gonna keep this one short but basically Seth Rogan brought none of the charm that he normally does to his roles In fact I have to say that this was one of those obnoxious main characters Ive seen a long time yeap a horrible protagonist He um had all the charm of a narcissist xxx boy the whole film and unlike other films for they kind of a narcisstic xxx boy but they bring something to the table you know theres something that just kind of makes tham so sl slightly endearing even though theyre kind of the jack ass you know youre like oh theyre still kind of cool no no hes unfunny not funny at all um hes just a jack ass um Kato kicks ass handsome guy boring hes boring just like look away what he can do he can do lots of stuff Sath Rogan goes like oh man that is so cool I cant believe you can do this stuff wow wow good thing youre my sidekick what wa what hes what w why you have no skills whatsoever you cant even tell funny jokes and than Cameron Diaz whos supposed to be plucky I guess but shes just kinf of useless Hi Im pretty I have a giant smile Im supposed to know thingsum walk of screen um yeah the characters didnt care weather they lived or died Kato was the only one that was any good whatsoever and he was still boring um yeah the special effects were OK nothing thats worth going to theaters to see and yeah I think the only character who actually showed their motivation bihind anything they did was the villain He was the only character that was slightly interesting who seemed to have genuine affection for other human beings and it was kind of interesting I mean the only character that shows genuine care for other people be the villain hmm yeah skip it dont see it I gue 
I just got back from the midnight showing of Saw 5 and I have to review before I go to sleep because Im still excited about it But I just want to let you guys know that the first part of this review will not have any spoilers and also you dont have to worry about it being ruind for you And the second half of this video is going to have spoilers but I will warn you beforehand so you can close out the video and than after you see Saw 5 you can come back and watch the spoilers Also be very vary of the comments underneath the video I would suggest that if you havent seen Saw 5 you shouldnt go to the comments because people are going to be commenting about the ending and stuff So if you havent seen Saw 5 dont check out the comments on this video either So hopefully you got all that now lets talk about Saw 5 As some of you might not notice I was extremly excited about Saw 5 OK all of you knew that obviously So I was you know really hyped up and excited to see it and I have to say that it was definately better than the Saw 4 not exectly what I was expecting but it was still really really really good and um its just made me really really excided for Saw 6 Now there were two plots going on in this movie One of them was great and the other one was completely irrelevant as far as I can tell The great plot was with Hoffman tying up all loose ends and stuff and the irrelevant plot was with five rendom strangers kind of like in Saw 2 who um you know have to go through these traps and stuff But I totally missed how it tied it to the movie at all and Im pretty sure thats because it didnt tie in to the movie at all So that was really bizzare and I didnt care about the characters at all because they werent you know introduced well really So it was just really really strange but luckily Hoffmans story um was a really really really awesome and um it totally made up for that so thats OK Of course as everyone knows the tag line of Saw 5 was you wont believe how it ends And I guess thats sort of true because I sure didnt see the end coming Im not gonna spoil it dont worry But the end was really you you know the Saw movies are known for it bigh twist endings and stuff but I thought the best part of Saw 5 was the storyline like in general Everything leading up to the ending the ending was not you know crazy shocking or anything like usual It was not a real huge Saw twist moment um so you know that was a little surprising I guess Thats not to say that the ending wasnt good because it really was but it was not exectly what I was expecting and se seriously everything leading up to the end was better than the ending which is still good because the movie is good Saw 5 has left like no closure at all at the end of the movie and it pretty much just left the door wide open for Saw 6 which obviously is already scheduled to come out next year So you know we knew it was coming and everything but man oh man it really left the door open and it didnt even you know try to close it at all like the wind isnt gonna blow it over or anything Its just open But like I said the plot of Hoffman and everything that was really really awesome and it fit very well into the Saw series in my opinion So congratulations to the writers for that But Ill smack them in the face for the other irrelevant plotline and dont know what the hell they were thinking It was pretty much just and excuse to put traps in the movie because it was literally completely irrelevant But whatever Like I said I loved the Hoffmans storyline so you know I guess it balances out David Hackl directed this movie and it was his first time directing a movie I think in general 
it is on I cant pronounce it properly indecisive and um god Insidious yeah Insidious um hm it is a horror movie and it is jumpy for people who dont like getting scared or jumpy or anything but for someone like me who loves horror movies and like I do jump though like Im not gonna like Im not gonna deny that but I dont exactly get scared its really a hard stuff I watched horror movies since I was like a baby so I think Im like immune to them and the only he mo film that Im really scared about is Small soldiers I just thats freaky as hell yeha um but Insidious um star really good like it cracked on streight away with what the hell is going on like it dosnt just like and I was at um theres a problem theres a story like adn its like streight away fun storyline started and some of the acting is a little bit like oh my god you wouldnt really do that but thats like old movies its just like I wouldnt say bad casting but its just sometimes its just a little bit like oh god they realy shouldnt have done that cringe um but really good like really jumped me my friend was sitting next to xxx and she wanted to go home and thats like seeing a lot for her coz she likes horror movies as much as I do but it really surprised as I said what you wanna go home huh but I am it was jumpy I jumped hell of a lot times and I would go to the cinema again to see it because that atmosphere like everyone just screeams and just and its just its so funny um something like what I do like if I jump a lot hah so everyone like everyone in cinema was kind like me because everytime that was like a jump everyone jumped you could feel the jump in and everyone was laughing afterwards I think thats how they cope with getting jum like scared and jump and stuff um but about I havent seen alien 45 minutes to an hour into the movie and and yeah actually Blake come down to the actual problem from there it does get a bit like huh not as real as what has been going on its kind of like quite fake like I just I couldnt believe it I was like what what are you doing but um Im not gonna give it away because there is people that wanna go and see it havent seen it yet and might see this video and I dont wanna be like oh this happens at the en 
 Everybody this is Amy also known as xxx xxx and Its actually almost 1230 at night right now or 1230 in the morning whatever however you wanna look at it Its pretty late at night if you couldnt already tell by my beautiful background Im not in my usual room this is my new college setting and I just got back from the movie theaters to go see a movie Ive been waiting probably about a year and a half to two years for if you are as big a fan of Disney as I am you know of course I was waithing for the Princess and the Frog I had some high exp o maybe not high expectations per se but I was definately expecting this to be a good movie and oh oh my gosh I was blown away I literally just got back like maybe fifteen or twenty minutes ago from seeing this movie with my best friend and her boyfriend Hi Maria hi Javier Anyway oh you can see Im still speechless this movie was just beautiful It was incredible see all the different color palettes smooth hand drawn animation you know remember the story was originally they said they were gonna stop doing hand drawn animated films after umHome on the Range because theyd said you know well xxx occurs it looks like everybody is just into computer animation these days and we are stories like Atlantis treasure planet and Lilo and Stich stop They arent doing so well Brother Bear so um I guess people just want to see um computer animated films from now on so were gonna stop I no Diseney lets take a look I mean I personally I liked Atlantis I liked Lilo and Stich I didnt really I mean Trasure Planet was OK I didnt really like ba Brother Bear and I hated Home on the Range It was oh I couldnt even watch it I was in the hospital in 9th grade for EEG and that was one of the movies they had on Oh god why did I watch that movie ah yeah and mean So we have a story based on fighting a lost civilization its kind of a darker story story based on Treasure Island story based on some rendom Hawaiian girl fighting a rendom alien and story about cows trying to save the farm I mean while Pixar is making films about pretty much agras 
 so lip smacking Xmen origins wolverine probably widely considered to be one of the failed one of the most failed movies of the Xmen franchise aright first of all id like to say little wolver james or jimmy hes so cute hes so xxx anyways lip smacking why does he yell for no reason after he finds out Im pretty sure the first time it happend you would be kinda freaked out the whole time you know but thats just me as far as i know sabre tooth and wolverine are not related as comic book wise and cartoon wise from where i know theyre not i may have to do some digging ill look into that sigh i love when they show all the the war scenes all the the time they spent in the military and shit thats freaking epic and i like how it shows you get to see progressively how sabre tooth is getting more and more aggressive its pretty sic i love the name wade but i do not take ryan reynolds seriously for shit in this movie i love him as an actor based on his looks as a actual talented actor no laughing he certainly doesnt fit the bill either for any marvel movie um zero after he busts all his caps in the air and rans and all the dead bodies fall around him fucking sick same with um wades uh sword scene where hes like sound effects its freaking epic um lip smacking sigh hm marvel once again decided to toss another random bitch in this movie wolverines bitch the random bitch that nobody knows where the fuck she came from why marvel why do you insist on torturing me lip smacking anyway lip smacking i love sabre tooth in this movie he was fucking epic lieb schriever or however the fuck you say his name is a fucking tremendously awesome actor ive never seen him in anything else but in this oh my god i love you and you probably did the best portrayal of sabre tooth ever although i do agree that the look could have been changed to fit the actual sabre tooths like with the right hair um we i love the scene where sabre tooth throws wolverine into the truck that feel good jackoff um fred dukes is the blob why did he get offended by being called 
 Hey guys um I saw Red Riding Hood finally xxx seeing Red Riding Hood for a really long time and um yeah me and Louis went yesterday and um Ill just say overall if I think it was good and than Ill say like some spoilers but um I liked it I thought it could be really bad um but it didnt look like it would be but It couldve been um I like did I thought Catherine Hardwicke did a good job and um I liked you know Catherine Hardwicke is like you know kind of ridiculous and she was kind of wierd during Twilight but um I I like seeing um female directors because there arent that many compare to you know guy directors so the more like women directors that I see you know I I I like seeing that so um I thought she did great with this movie um anyway I would say just you go and see it if you were thinking about seeing it but you werent sure if it would be worth seeing um I say go see it coz I I enjoyed it now um some spoilers I guess um yeah spoilers um I hm I dont like well I dont know if I wanna say I dont like this but I wish that it wouldve been different who the wolf actually turned out to be um I just I wouldve like me and Louis were saying we were thinking the whole time like who couldve be who couldve be um we had like we have guessed everybody um this like this random charecter dude who what does he do I dont remember I dont know how to like tell you who he is coz youre gonna be like that doesnt narrow it down at all Its just like this this character whos kind of random and he has brown hair and he I dont I think he maybe he got mad when hah I dont know um but yeah whatever um he we thought it would be him because they werent showing him a lot but they showed him enough to they kind of be like oh it was him in the end but it wasnt him um a I wish we wished that it wouldve been um the guy um oh my laptop is running out of battery um we wished it wouldve been Peter because it wouldve made sense throat cleaning that um Peter like we wanted to be that she knew um Amanda Seyfrieds character knew it was PEter but was pretending that she didnt so that she got a reason to run away with him and they could be together thats what we kind of thought and it would make sense and and we kind of wanted it to be like but exept not that obvoious but that wouldve been good right like coz that it would give tham a reason coz they wanted to get married but they couldnc because she was gonna marry the other guy and another thing the other guy she was supposed to marry was a hundred times better looking than Peter was nicer than Peter I was saying if shes not gonna marry him I will because she picked the wrong but anyway thats irrelevant um throat clearing coming below he thought he was really happy because I thought he was um Peter was annoying I didnt like Peter um but 
Hello you tube civilians Snowman here and today Im going to review Zombieland the new movie starring Jesie Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson the plot follows two survivors of a zombie apocalipse called Columbos played by Jesie Eisenberg and Tallahasse played by Woody Harrlson who have named themselves after the places um to which they have traveled in which I think is a really nice xxx as they do want to avoid becoming emotionally attached to each other Now Columbos is a basically um OCD like hes got loads of rules of how to um survive the zombie apocalipse and hes kind of always been a social outcast and a bit of a loner and when he meets Tallahasse who is like xxx kind of almost battleship crazy zombie killer the um cross of personality is really um charismatic and dynamic and i um odds are really coming later to the film Its not long before they meet two girls one of which is called Wichita um who um Columbos falles for and her smaller sister called I think is Little Rock and basically the um these girls try to get one over of the guys all the time like steal the truck steal the armour all thats still um it just goes to show that you really cant trust anyone in this situation Zombieland is a really sucessful horror comedy as it contains um rea really well done and faithful homages to the zombie horror sub ganre and um while also maintains its kind of detached um satire of the genre but its really well done I have to say that afore the credit sequence which I wont give too much away because um you really wanna see it for yourself um its basically a um slow motion show case of different events this credit sequence I think is the best credit sequence um since Watchman and I honestly think if we hadnt have seen Watchman this would be the best credit sequence of the year yeah it really is good I mean It uses um and this just doesnt apply to the um um credit se sequence on it own but appies to the movie as a whole It really knows how to use s slow motion without making it a gimmick The sequences of the beginning of the film which features Columbus exzplaining some of his rules um to surviving a zombie apocalipse are really well done Well rule number one cardio you know the fat people die first in the apocalipse and stuff like that The xxx sequence is really well done i dont wanna go into his rules because I really dont wanna spoil it for people but its a very kind of um stylistic edge on it it its almost like um imagining Tarantino directed a zombie movie and the style of the film like the um the free streams of slow motion the um the jump cooks and all that stuff feels very kind of um Tarantino ask and I got a real quick out it because I think it realy su 
 hello and this is my review of season of the witch this movie was horrible nicholas cage should not do these kind of movies hes always in these kinds of movies all this sorcerer witch voodoo kind of movies and its getting really tiring hes horrible at it no one takes him seriously w w w when hes onscreen i want to punch him in the face hes very boring he wa he was very annoying he didnt know what he was talking about and i was sitting in the theatre sleeping rob perlman was in this movie too he is in hellboy he was very good in hellboy but in this movie he wasnt good at all i i i didnt really care for his character at all hes very boring as well whole movies very boring it made no sense it it it took place in the 14th century about these witches and stuff i didnt really care about it at all i had no idea why i even saw this movie uh the trailer looked like it could be a little g good but when i saw it was just totally boring i this movie was pushed back til this year it was supposed to come out like l like last year but it wasnt really made well and so they pushed it back unt in January i seen about three movies this year so far and this is the worst by far it was very very very boring made no sense action scense were very dumb i hated it but the last half hour of the movie it felt like they had added like a cgi orgasm you know they just tried uh with the cgi that they put t t t they they threw so much cgi at you and it was awful like it was like spewing cgi last half hour of the movie like every single scene was cgi it was terrible i hated it i was sitting there in the theatre laughing how bad the movie was at some points uh huh how about the acting and the action was was just so dull and boring do not see this movie season of the witch was horrible acting dull just dont see this movie i dont know why i even saw it so season of the witch is rated 3 out of 10 so there you go bye 
I mean it starts out really slow and you get a kind of back story about the the whole green lantern thing and what theyre all about and how it was all created then it takes you to Earth where Ryan Reynolds character Hal Jordan is a hot headed pilot who gets into a lot of trouble in one xxx um turns out hes chosen to represent the green lanterns um from Earth so not to spoil anything but um he goes he trains and um turns out hes got to fight off this evil um thing called the Parallax which um feeds off a fear and the green lantern represents will power so its about little will power versus fear and its just coming to Earth and its gonna destroy everything so hes got to try to find the way to stop it essentially before it destroys everything because its just feeding off a fear then theres this theres also subplot villain um Hector Hammond who because exposed th by the fear and starts mutating and turning into a villain and I wont tell you what happens with that or what the ending result is or anything like that but overall um go see it it was a cool movie the acting was allright um I thought they casted kind of well but what really threw me off was the dialogue very cheezy dialogue oh my god the whole movie had a really dry dialogue there were a couple funny parts but I dont think the humour redeemed the movie from being so bad in the dialogue department whoever wrote this isnt the writer definatelly but overall I enjoyed it the the whole movie I was you know thinking this isn as bad as Ive heard and it wasnt um and the movie was pretty short as like an hour and a half and the dialogue threw me off other than that um I think it was and OK movie definatelly a little bit above average I dont think its as bad as you probably read on reviews so yeah go see it tell me what you think adios 
xxx whitnessing the changes and growth of the characters its usaulaly a path of discovery but how do you keep characters developing an sequel after sequel after sequel Shrek forever after or is it called the final chapter the last minute title that they threw on at the theaters Dreamworks is confusing me they solved this dilemma by removing the past within its a wonderful life twist courtecy of new betty Rumpelstiltskin everything that happened in Shrek 1 2 and 3 are wiped away its a clean sweep of Shreks life where he can now be a single grumpy ogre again without the burdens of being a husband and a father not a bad idea for a sequel but also not very original Shrek 4 misses out on the magic that made the first film a real joy to view gone are the wickedly satirical stand ups of the world of fairy tales and also the cute wings to pop culture and their place is a run of the mill animated action adventure plot with a few chuckles trown in it seems like the writers and creators took the easy way out if award for the great characters of Shrek in his supporting cast they are still voiced by the original stars Mike Myers Eddie Murphy Cameron Diaz and Antonio Banderas the film would be a real bust unless your kids are dying to see it Id wait for the DVD I give Shrek forever after directed by Mike Mitchell a grade of B minus Im Keith Kelly music 
so here we have another hasbro d production coming out of the movie business first we had transformers now we got GI Joe so we got GI the rise of the cobra starring Channing tatum and marlon wayans and dennis quaid um the movie starts off marlon and channing are playing rip cord and doom theyre both two dudes in the military and theyre transporting this uh like this nanotech technology if youve seen the trailer you know when they shoot the big bazooka at the eiffel tower and it falls and it makes all that crumble pretty much little robots in that thats making things break apart um so channing tatum and marlon are transporting it they get ambushed by um i think its cobra its kinda hard to explain it cuz its like the dude that made the technologies i i cant ruin the movie so Im not gonna tell you what the plot is but they get ambushed by some dudes with some ill technology and then the joes come and save them from the bad guys that want to steal the the war warheads so they go down and they meet dennis quaid the leader of the gi joe program and they get recruited into the joe program um from there it just goes into ridiculousness the thing about this movie is like i i i wanna compare it to transformers 2 and i actually did i was like you know theyre both hasbro toys theyre both moves that are com made for children but they have a lot of adult situations in it but the thing about gi joe compared to transformers is transfomers 2 didnt know what it wanted to do like in some parts you had people getting killed and the next part you had fart jokes and stupid frat humor and all that other crap as for gi joe was it was just like laughing its the the plot the the acting is terrible the plot is ridiculous but no one took it seriously like like even the actors were just like you know its a movie about a fucking toy so were just gonna just do whatever we gonna do laughing so theyre just sitting there like this one part where the girls like my daddy taught me to WIN WIN and then shes looking in the camera and im like wow like um this actings pretty bad but the they they knew it was just a movie about a a a a doll so they didnt take it seriously like i didnt i didnt grow up watching gi joe i didnt have any of the action figures im sorry i said dolls earlier please dont kill me but i didnt have any of the gi joe action figures i didnt watch the cartoons i know some of the little catch phrases like knowing is half the battle and all that joint which they throw in here like every two seconds but the movie was well it was ridiculously terrible like it was like the acting was terrible the action made up for it there was parts this ive seen some creative depths in this movie ive never seen before ive seen people get shot in the eye you know and that would be it but people getting shot in the eye and then the they heads explode and then some dude get his torso cut open and and some dudes hanging out of the car his head got blown off and freaking people are flying and jumping i mean i was i cant say i saw this movie and i wasnt 
 I just want you all to know that just do we dont have to delay this review until Saturday i drove an hour each way to catch a midnight showing of this movie so you better appreciate this review i know the majority of the people who watch my reviews arent actually my subscribers but to any of you who are i expect a thumbs up got it but anyway lets start with the obvious who the killer was or killers theyre back to you having two killers thankfully because it does make a lot more sense having the killer be able to be everywhere if theres two of them okay first off here were the two guys in the trailer who were laying out the rules the assistant killer basically was the one with the long hair not the one with the camera hes killed and the main killer was Sidneys cousin Jill who was tired of living in Sidneys shadow and has decided to stage a remake of the original movie in which she can take Sidneys place at the end and so her basic goal is reenact the original movie only upping the ante on every single scene exactly as modern remakes do hmph my overall opinion of the results of this process are its better than Scream 3 and actually is better than Scream 2 a lot of people dont like scream 2 i think its highly underrated i hated Scream 3 but i think this one did beat Scream 2 Now i didnt really like the first hour that much though im sure you all remember the stab movies that were based on the scream movies or the experiences of Sidney in universe so that people could comment on the killers reenacting the movies or following up the movies well in the first hour those become way way way too much of a plot point basically theres now seven of them the fifth one apparently features time travel i think xxx i want to see it but anyway but it actually basically makes the characters congition not just of the genre within which they are in but of their own franchise to a ridiculous extent Im just kinda like no this is going to far there are only 3 scream movies 
 good evening friends this video was originally supposed to be Alfred Hitchcok Psycho versus the Curious case of Benjamin Button but I decided to do away of that crap so its just gonna be a review of Benjamin Button and the Curious Case of Benjamin Button what whatever the name is too long the curious case of Benjamin Button is a David Finchers film starring Brad Pitt as a man who was born old and grows progresivly younger as he grows older its a very interesting idea and its they looked like it had a good core but hm it just too many problems with it the first problem is that its all told in flashback from a point just before Katrina hits New Orleans I didnt need any of that crap I dont need it all told in flashback I dont need the added element of Katrina it dosent it just its too much crap in here the the movies is too long they just need to cut that out another thing is we dont need his entire life th we do not need the entire span birth to death just give me a nice interesting choke and scale it down on like two hours this also falls in to the trandy is very popular these days if you do a whole all of CGI um and if youre gonna do mostly CGI just make an animated movie this looks like it just has a polyurethane coating on it makes him look too too good but dont get me wrong its not all bad its got my two favorite acresses in it Tilda Swinton and Cate Blanchett like I said before Is a very interesting idea and they did a lot of good things with it but its its like someone made you a kick ass sandwich but they put mayonnaise on it and you dont like mayonnaise and its not like tomato or lettuce where you can pick it off no its got it mayonnaise in its all over everything and now youre stuck with this kick ass sandwich that would be kick ass if it didnt have mayonnaise on it but it has mayonnaise on it or you go make another sandwich go make another sandwich this movie is just not quite good enough I really liked David Finch I liked all the um I like the cast but and its a good story but clap huh its a pass my neighbor probably thinks Im crazy yelling about movies to a camera 
 Hi Im Michael and Im Michael the movie man Today were reviewing Sucker punch this is the new film by Zack Snyder the director of Three hundred and the Watchman and this is Snyders first film thats not based on preexisting work Now getting to set up of Sucker punch which Ill get to in a minute it only had the potential to be a film that was both provking and action packed but unfortunately its just an ugly wild violent unvolving and sadistic exercise that I got very little joy out of in fact I got mostly pain out of it the story invoves young girl played by Emily Browning and after her mother dies she and her sister are sent to live with their evil stepfather after going through tons of abuse thats pretty heavily inferred in the opening sequence the young girl besides to try to escape but she ends up killing her sister by accident and than shes insitutionalized with her stepfather and is set up to have a lobotomy thankfully shes shes saved from the lobotomty by the head nurse and shes sent to work at the night club thats run by this other sadistic man named Boyo and where the girl who gets the nickmname babydoll when she gets there is forced to not only be trapped in the vocation that she obviously doesnt wanna be in but she also has to dance and satisfy some horny man that come in now it also takes so really creepy xxxof the fact that Emily Browning in this movie looks like shes underage even though I know for su for a fact that shes not underage in real life and movie itself says shes twenty but I dont know Ill get to that in a little bit anyway Babydolls than forced to dance for the first time by by the order of the dance instructor there the dance coordinator whos played by Carla Gugino and when she dances she goes into this alternate world that kind of looks like video game in a certain way in fact the first time she goes in it looks like a Japanese temple and later time she goes like a World War II battlefield um castle this kind of pulled out of Lord of the Rings anyway the first time she goes in she meets this prophet whos played by Scott Glenn and he tells her that she can escape from the world shes in by collecting a group of items and than one other itam that is shell gonna have to find out for herself what that is throat cleaning anyway so she gets the idea that hey we can escape and she tries to get the other girls who are dancing at the night club to and also trapped there to join in and shes able to and basically the rest of the movie is them going into or going back into babydolls dream worlds to try and collect all these items even though they are actually collecting the items within the real world and actually theres a lot of things going on as far as whats in Babydolls mind whats in her mind within her mind in a way its kind of like inception in that way its kind of playing with the idea whats real whats not what the Matrix films did although actually the best comparison this is this film would actually be something like Pans Labyrinth 
I wanna give you guys a quick spoiler free review of the movie summer blockbuster I would put money on it that it is going to be the blockbuster hit of the summer in terms of when you look at all the movies I Im a cap guy Captain america fan I think that would do very well but Thor just look at the numbers what it did last night it did three point um two five million just on midnight shows alone over on the opening night I just saw report from Friday the first two days were out um in the lot of theaters had when you look at the imax in 3D and 2D um so I think Thor is really gonna do well I think its gonna catapult Chris Hemsworth to be even a bigger star um I know he already did a remake of Red Dawn um great 80s movie for those who havent seen it originally with Patrick Swayze and Charlie Sheen by the way Charlie Sheen was winning there and hes winning no um and they actually moved Red dawn back to later this year so they could um um kind of get a little bit of Chris Hemsworth star power into that um great movie overall they did very well to establish the character of Thor the problem with a lot of comic book shows and movies and you saw this with the NBC recent flop of the Cape which is a show I love but the audience that was watching it they needed they needed a pay off right away and they needed character established right away um what you get in the sitcoms in terms of comic books and kind of the movies that take so loud to build that and why is this person wearing tights or why are they carrying a hammer you know why what is their mission or why why are they here you have to establsih that fairly quickly and I think that directors of Thor and the script writers did that right away you saw Thor for how hes in the comics pompous an arogant individual you saw what happens to him you saw how he ends up on Earth um but they also did a great job in building the backstory of Jane Foster played by Natalie Portman and her crew and how they relate to Thor so I think that was really good they didnt belabored Thor on Earth he sounded like he didnt learn from the earthlings um if if you are true Marvel comic fan you know that Thor in the comics thinks hes better because hes a god you know he always makes comments like oh gama radiation can hurt you it cant hurt us guardians were gods and hes right about that so he gets to he gets to Earth and see what happens there all while youre seeing whats going on with xxx and Loki and I think there was another great thing um this is not a spoiler but Marvel has already publicly announced that Loki will be the main bad guy in the adventures which makes sense because if you go back in adventures lower youll see that Loki was originally the reason why the adventures hat to be put together um so that makes sense um so they established Loki the established the relationshop between Thor Loki and Odin um they go back until some of Loki history that would only hard core comic fans know um huh Sif um and um Im forgetting the guy with the red beard I forget his name um um their group they establish they establish everything um they get the Earth you get other whole shield involvement which is cool to see that a lot of cooler references that at one point they reference Im a doctor with gama radiation um which are those moral fans ot all the trouble Petty Gross who was played by Liv Tyler in the Incredible Hulk movie a couple of years ago the refer 
 OK so hi everyone this is my first movie review so I watched Burlesque the past week and well it was another movie considering you know thats theres not much xxx video in Singapore to lease so um first things first Christina Aguileras xxx I swear the xxx xxx um why I said that is because she is god a crazy crazy voice and she sure can sing really really well in this movie you know she sings tough love and you know the classic songs and you know it makes you wanna know who else you know in the history of nowadays has the voice like that and you know its noone xxxit you know that she gets to choose the song because shes the executive music producer in the movie so you know she should be next xxx voice anyway next would be Cher who has been away for like probably centuries I think but you know she my mom says shes probably like 60 70 years old but she still looks like shes 48 and her face doesnt move at all coz when you see her face moves it feels like you know you feel worried for her you feel like her face is going to fall apart and overall the movies quite entertaining that the dancers um wonderful its sexy but not slutty you know theres not much of nudity exept for you know for the male lead who is drop dead gorgeous by the way but Im the girl so thats not the point the point is um the songs in the movie are wonderful you know it matches the whole theme of the movie you know cabaret and you know the looks and overall probably Id give it about 35 stars you know popcorn movie and you know considering all the awesome movies that we had and xxx Inception the Black Swan and you know the Social Network this one you know probably in the middle so 35 stars and if you have money to spend go ahead 
Hey guys I have a very short movie review for you Last night I went to see the movie Rio which is the animated movie um it is um produced by the same company um that produced the I Iceage movies um and in that respect it very similar starts up with the baby a lot of those movies produced by that company tend to start up with baby animals to tug at the heart strenghts although I think Iceage started up with the baby human yeah anywayit was a really cute movie I did not think I was gonna like it I really didnt wanna go see it um Ill tell you why they start up pushing that movie at least 6 months ago in the theaters and trailers and it seems to me than when production companies start pushing movies that far ahead and when they were gonna be released that usaually means that they are not gonna be great and I was pleasantly surprised by this movie I was I thoroughly enjoyed it um this is a great family movie to take your whole family to this movie its great for all ages um I thought the story line was really cute and again it does really tug at the heart strenghts with the little baby animals at the beginning um it has it has a very predictable story that so what is still a really great movie to take your whole family to um I thought that the actors who did the voices and Ill list all of those in the information box because I dont really remember who all of them were Anne Hathaway that sticks out of my mind and um Eisenberg um whats his first name I dont know but he did the voice of the main character Anne Hathaway did the voice of his love interest and I dont know if Anne Hathaway did the singing theres a little bit of singing in this movie but if it was Anne Hathaway who did the singing she did a great job I had no idea that Anne Hathaway could really sing If thats her singing anyway um I would recommend it if if youre like me and you dont normally go to see animated movies and Im Im not really in a big hurry at my age to go see animated movies um but there really hasnt been much to has come out this year so far that Im dying to go see and we really wanted to get out of the house um last night Yesterday was Easter so we went to the theater and that was showing um and so we did go to see it and I was thoroughly um surprised at how much I really did enjoy it So I would recommend this movie um anyway thanks for watchingyou guys have a great day bye 
So I went to the premiere of the Christmas Carol It was amazing the premiere itself was really cool but Im gonna tell you about that in another video because otherwise this video will be mega mega long This video is about the film itself and I actually liked the film a lot and I wasnt expecting to because I thought how the hell is Dickens and Disney gonna work together like this So kind of opposite but I thought they actually worked pretty well If you dont know the story that well its all about guy this old guy called Scrooge whos really mean and he never spends any money on anyone and I guess visited by these three ghosts the ghost of Christams past the ghost of Christmas present and the ghost of Christmas yet to come and they show him you know what his life has been like what it is like now what is going to be like if he keeps being like he is But yeah than he changes his ways and xxxin the end and the end part is really really funny because hes been such a grumpy character and hes really scared and in the end hes so changed and hes really funny hes like what a delightful child and its all kind of its hard to explain but if you see it than youll understand what I mean the animation was amazing I wasnt expecting that much because sometimes 3D isnt really that good but it was fenomenal you kind of forget about the fact that it is 3D the voices are really good that was one of my other concerns was that as an English person I get really annoyed when American shows and films have an English character but than its so obviously not an English character but yeah generally the accents were really really good so good one you America for doing that hah America the the land that made this film what else I doubt that theyre gonna do this for all the screenings because it was the premiere On each seat there was the um a bottle of water a bar of chocolate and a bag of humbugs I would not have chosen to go and see that but Im really really really glad I saw it and I would recommend it to other people its true even though I was like hu Im gonna hate it but Im just gonna have to say it Its my favorite film ever um its not my favorite film ever but I would definately watch it again I can imagine getting this on DVD and watching it at Christmas at time because it makes you feel so like huh its not about commercialization its about you know families being together Anyway next video is going to be the footage from the thing and Ill tell you all about like the cool premiere and stuff and Im sorry its over the mid way but I just wanted to put this up soon Hes xxxtakes of me trying to make this video early on which were um a disasterous so enjoy and yes see you next video throat cleaning um singing coughing whats wrong with me laughter amazing 
 hey welcome to foxs den today i saw a uh movie called hannah and i saw a couple reviews before i went and i was pretty open to to it being good i at first when i saw the previews i thought it was gonna be stupid to be perfectly honest i thought hannah was gonna suck i was like theres no way that theyre gonna be able to convince me that a sixteen year old girl can take down like six adult dudes so i saw some other reviews and i was like okay i was surprised because these are some people that i trust i i beyond the trailer jeremy jenz these are the people that i get get my my stuff from my reviews so i watched those reviews and they both liked it they s and all the people walking out of the theatre and beyond the trailer really liked it so went and saw it today with some friends and i gotta say i wasnt blown away by it i didnt think it was great or epic or just fantastic it was good i mean i dont regret seeing it it was it was an it was an okay movie basically you have this little girl that uh um eric bana decides to train to be this most paranoid asassin chick in the world because i don i dont wanna give it away because if i say why then youre gonna know anyways skipping past that shes got this like kick A attitude shes gonna you know go in and wipe out this xxx so its it kind of feels like a sundance film festival type of movie its good but its not great its not polished quite as much as i would like it to be it is good though like they convinced me like this chick could probably take that dude down which is pretty hard because i went into the movie thinking theres no way and so they kind of explain it a little bit but not really um i i at the end of the movie the friends i was with uh one of them goes was there a plot to this movie it doesnt have a deep seeded plot theres not like a really good twist its a good action movie its like 90 bourne identity meets 10 willy wonka theres some really strange characters in this movie that i i dont know where they came from it was it did add to the movie though it and it visually its kinda cool how they show her confusion because she grows up in the woods you see that in the trailer shes in the woods like training and stuff so you see it through the video kind of how once she gets into society things are not normal for her they it it kind of spins out of control shes never see a lot of this stuff so it it was and interesting movie it was original and i liked it the soundtrack was interesting um it wasnt bad but it was it was interesting it wasnt the it wasnt the usual i did like kind of like the action the music kinda drove a lot of the action which is cool and so i would say i 
 so Kate Hudson has a new movie its called Something borrowed Its one of those romantic comedies that we all dread Now the real star of Something borrowed is Ginnifer Goodwin who you might remember from Walk the line also in this movie is John Krasinski and newcomer Colin Egglesfield I think its how you pronounce his name now Kate Hudson plays herself in this movie Annoyingly she kind of yells and screams through the whole movie and if you can tolerate her the rest of the movie isnt any batter um it kind of follows the path of My best friends wedding 1997 Julia Roberts movie except it takes thirty minutes longer to deviate from the scripts of My best friends wedding there are some funny moments but mostly its just Kate Hudson being very annoying and I think its predictable up an to a point I think with with these kind of movies we kind of predict and we second guess ourselves so I will give it points for not being exactly like My best friends wedding even at the trailer sets it up that way Ginnifer Goodwin is fun to watch but I dont think shes leading material and like I said Kate Hudson couldnt be more annoying here If there is any silverlining in this movie its John Krasinski who I dont usually like but he has some of the funniest scenes in this movie He seems to be the only realistic character here Something borrowed opens in May its gonna be playing nationwide its rated PG 13 for texas art and film Im Dustin Chase and for the full review of Something Borrowed check out texasartfilmcom 
 the new film Hanna staring Eric Bana Cate Blanchett and it lead star as Hanna Saoirse Ronan who is Academy Award nominee for her film Atonement Now this film is directed by Joe Wright who had directed Atonement and Pride and Prejudice and the big flaw the Soloist This is his most engaging endevour yet Its Joe Wright the action director here and he what he does with Hanna is he makes the movie on like anything weve seen before He takes great actors or acresses in this case like Saoirse Ronan and Cate Blanchett and he puts them in very strange and unusual characters We se Cate Blanchett as an FBI agent with the texas straw and big fake teeth and um Saoirse Ronan as this k kind of Kill Billish action star child um what really need about this movie is the Chamical brothers did the soundtracks whats pulse pounding the entire way through you never know whats gonna happen Theres all these colorful characters Now it isnt a great fantastic tell everybody about that kind of movie I gave it a B but I think its one of those movies thats so unique that you respect that Joe Wright tried to do something completely different here Its colorful its in your face its really non stop from beginning to end and I think um what I took away from this was that really tried very hard to make something original and something that I cant find anything else to compare it to um Hanna is reted PG 13 It is in cinemas everywhere this weekend for my full review on Hanna check out texasartfilmcom Im Dustin Chase 
um I broke my own rule last night and I went to watch the movie before I read the book which is a big nono for me I always like to read the book first its a weird thing I dont know but I did go to watch the movie because Priscilla from the readables gave a such a good review and I just couldng hold off any longer and I had to go watch it um I suggest that you guys go and watch this movie it was so good um its surpassed my expectations um usually Im not really a big huge Scifi alien kind of fan but um it was really really good um I really wanna go read the book now coz Im so curious to see um how the storyline um got to that point I heard that in the book it describes um the plan of the glory a lot better um gives more details so I cant wait to get my hands on it now I have been going on a binge with buying books and I promised I wasnt gonna by anymore but I really needed um I cant wait until the next one comes out too um the Power of six I believe that its called so I googled it on um the internet um it it turns out that James Fray who um I realy like He wrote a a million little pieces um I know he was hes kind of controversial because he got some um slack about um adding stuff into his memoirs that um were was made up but lets just cancel all that out um he wrote a good book hes in hes behind I am number four him and a team of other writers um and I cant wait for the next one to come out Im really excited um as for Alex xxx I am a new Alex fan he was unbelievable so easy on the eyes um I think hes my new favorite yeah so i suggest that you guys all watch this movie leave me a comment telling me what you thought of the movie and Ill talk to you soon bye bye 
 hey everubody I hope youre having a great day I wanted to give my review of Briends with benefits mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake I thought they made a great duo Mila Kunis she is gorgeous theres some great bedroom scenes you guys are youre gonna get to enjoy a fine light weight day movie I think some of the women are going to enjoy this more than the guys um certainly there are some scenes where I think some of the women are gonna feel more the emotion of it there are some funny lines great steamy bedroom scenes I was surprised um the amount of skin they showed but um it was in a good taste um and I thought Woody Harelson was a funny he um added a grat dimension to the movie as well storyline was OK but overall I thought it was it was a fun picture I I do think its worth seeing um certianly again more of a day movie than um seeing it alone unless you ladies go together to see it together so Id go see it thumbs up and um until the next video have a great day 
so i mean the title says it all for this movie battle for los angeles aliens invade they attack all the world and theyre coming but you dont know why and theyre just attacking from every point on the earth and its just a worldwide invasion and theyre about to takeover los angeles so and theres a plot with uh theres erin eckhart and his crew who are in la trying to stop the aliens alright so whats good about this movie the action is fucking awesome the action is really really well directed its very reminscent of district 9 its like someone watched the third act of district 9 a bunch of times like lets make this into an entire movie itll be awesome and thats pretty much what they did here but it didnt turn out quite nearly as awesome as that movie did in fact this movie isnt even on the same level as district 9 nor is it um for uh black hawk down which people are comparing it to i didnt really see a comparison to black hawk down until like the very very end but nevertheless another really cool thing about this movie the aliens are really awesome they designed the aliens in a really cool unique way to make them like biotic but also mechanical and they have really cool technology thats really interesting to watch like make them blow up shit and you know and they always like pull out something new but its not always quite explained you know like everything about the aliens but they give you a good amount of information about them like enough that it actually is a good reason why they why theyre attacking and it keeps your interests in the action scenes at least during this movie so and now we get to whats bad about this movie uh the dialogue is terrible there is no good dialogue nothing in this movie is cleverly written everything they say just sounds so fucking stupid the only actor who can really sell their lines is erin eckart there are moments where he says something youre like that just sounded dumb as hell but he totally sells it just to put this in perspective the last line of the movie goes like this erin eckhart gets asked something he turns hes like weve already had breakfast thats his last line like i mean im an actor but i kinda would have read that been like hm i mean schwarzanegger never said anything really that badass in his movies but arite and moving on theres no character development in this movie none the characters they tried to show a little something for them and people were telling me that this isnt that kind of a movie where theyre developing characters well i can tell you right now i dont remember the names of any characters none of them were memborable and they were all just really bland and forgettable and one o another big problem with this movie its two hours long okay at around right before the third act and it really gets action packed theres like 
I havent posted a video because Ive been busy with school I have like four weeks left and it has been crazy trying to get final projects done and situated but um and mid terms so anyway Im back to do a review for you guys I have not seen Robin Hood yet so Im not reviewing that and I was gonna see McGruber this weekend and I still might so there might be review some time later from McGruber review but Im here to review Shrek forever after which I was not excited to see and it actually surprised me um to summarize it Shrek forever after is not Shrek hes in life and basically his life is repetitive same thing every day and than he realizes he just has a freak out momemnt he realizes that this isnt he wants to be a regular ogre again blah blah blah kind of goes on he meets Rumpelstiltskin and he signs a contract for being one day as an ogre and he has to give up one day in his past you know like one day of his life he couldnt remember well Rumpelstiltskin is tricky and what happens is that Shrek is transported to xxx ogre but then he cho Rumpelstiltskin chose the day Shrek was born so that Shrek never said Fiona he could be entrapped in castle of Rumpelstiltskin basically thats it and I have to admit I I like Shrek I do I like the first two Shreks quite a bit um theyve become quite a bit overrated but the first two were pretty excellent the third one was a piece of crap and thats why I was not excited about the fourth one um which actually was really good I did like the fourth one quite a bit um I I did enjoy it it reminded me of the first one had the same kind of vibe like the first one and it just was better maybe its the baby ogres maybe bringing in the baby ogres really brought it down coz the first two were great and they brought in the kids and it made it more kiddy friendly movie the first two were kid movies but they were had adult humour I though that adults would appreciate and would go over the kids heads and this is what the fourth one kind of has the third one was more kid humour though it didnt have that much adult humour in it um yeah the fourth one it does have kid humour definatelly its a kids movie but it does have some adult humour those are quote in this movie that sounded so dirty coming out but it as great did anyone notice yes um something about waffle hole am I the only one am I perverted not to think that that sounds dirty coz it totally does waffle hole it had me laughing out loud and I dont think that many other people were laughing about it but I was um creepy seventeen year old in the audience with her cousins who are five and four and yeah hah thats what happened um yeah its its better than the third one absolutely I didnt see it in 3D because my one of my cousins doesnt like the glasses 
who to review of the Final destination which I did get a chance to see this weekend on Saturday but I didnt have time to review it I wasnt planning on reviewing it but its actually worth talking about because the movie itself is the same old crap from the series and I actually am not finding the series to be very fun and popcorn kind of movie You just cant walk in exopecting anything other than that um you know you got your kid who cen see in the future he sees that everyone all his friends are gonna die in a horrific accident he averts the accident and saves all his friends so you know karma kicks in and death says no Im gonna come get you and you know you cant escape me and um you know one by one they get picked off in the same order they wouldve died in the original accident and you know the main kid it um its its his job to save everyone essentially convince them that its true in this case it didnt take much convincing which is a little silly but the acting is bad the plot is you know actually the acting is OK I guess for this kind of movie the plot is is is threadbare the the um character development is nil but none of those things matter its a fun movie anyway its a popcorn movie and the main thing I wanna talk about is this dolby 3D um its not real D like the normal 3D thats been around recently the with the plastic black kind of buddy holly glasses this is a different kind of glasses and Ill show a picture right now I took it with my cell phone camera which is a terrible picture but hopefuly it will give you an idea what theyre like theyve actually got a little sensor on the side that wont let you leave the theater its like something youde see on article of clothing in the department store um but um this 3D definatelly looks a lot better I think that real D it corrects some of the issues that that had like I I found the real D the image was still sort of misaligned even with the glasses on um and um this this corrects that problem completetly at least where I was sitting I was sitting right in the middle of the theater I had ideal seats because its good to sit right in the middle of the theater with 3D and um at least in my experience it is um but the they looked awesome the 3D itself really had improved it looks like things are actually coming out at you um the color looked great coz sometimes 3D can mess up the color at least the old anaglyphic 3D I think real D it you know had sort of had sort of tempted but it winds itself its also um not ideal for for the imigae itslef um but this looked amazing looked really good and it makes it worth going to see this movie if youve got um the dolby 3D somewhere in your town weve got at the Studio movie grill theater chain in North Texas theyve theyve bought the system and theyve invested millions of dollars into these glasses um so they obviously expected to make a lot of money and I hope this takes over as the new system I would love that that be that would be cool to see I mean eventually were gonna get burned out as a soci as a society once agian were gonna be burned out on 3D because its it is a gimmick ultmatelly um but I will say um with this with this quality of 3D you could almost make you know a regular like a dramatic movie or an action movie or something that was really good movie and you could make it 3D and it wouldnt at all

so I went to see Sex and the City 2 and let me tell you it surpassed itself it reached the new hights of horrendous this movie isnt just bad its diabolical first let me just say I saw quite a few guys at the cinema who clearly been dragged there by the girlfriends and to those guys I say would you like me to sew your balls back on for you also if youre a streight man and you voluntarily willingly goo and see this film Im gonna need you to light a candle say a prayer and ask yourself some questions so the movie starts with the wedding of Stanford and Anthony you know those two gay characters who hated each other throughout the entire TV series yeah them this is really just a continuation of the first film where we learned that once you reach a certain age you should just settle so this just shows us that basically that rule applies whether youre gay or streight and if you didnt understand that two men joining together in holy matrimony I shouldve constituted its a gay wedding they throw Lisa Minneli in there just to hammer the point xxxfor you Carry Carry storyline we pick up where shes been married for two years to Big and shes worried that the sparkle is going out of her marriage shes worried about that because now Big wants to stay home order take out and watch black and white movies where the problem with that lies not entirely sure so when they go to Abu Dhabi she bumps into Aiden her ex boyfriend and they kiss if you feel like that was a spoiler you hadnt actually predicted that that would happen while watching the trailer clearly you rode the special bus to school she kisses Aiden freaks out calls Big grovelling lets just remember shes grovelling to the man who actually jilted her at the altar in the first movie um when she gets home she appologizes to Big in person and he gives her a giant black diamond to remind her that shes married so lets just recap being married to Big means you order take out watch black and white movies and get giant black diamonds when you cheat sign me up Charlotte Charlotte who doesnt work and has full time help xxx motherhood heart oh diddums let me see if I can rustle up some symphaty yeah Ive got nothing what sends her over the edge is that her daughter gets some food on Charlottes vintage Valentio skirt that she happens to be wearing while theyre making cupcakes um that just sends her into the down with spiral of a tears angry angry overworked mother tears I dont know if Charlotte started on made me never want to have kids or never want to have rich friends Miranda Miranda was always one of the best characters She was a working mother high powerd lawyer really razorsharp witts now she gets all upset because her boss doesnt like her so her husband Steve bar manager Steve th 
 Lets talk Legend of the guardians Im gonna give this a grade B minus the CGI work the 3D is spectacular the flying sequences are beautiful and the owls are really wonderful and come of real and they do have very nice personalites and you have a rate for them but the story is very dark in fact my six years old was scared most of the movie basic just is its just good owls versus bad owls the bad owls kidnap two little good owls and one of them escapes and runs off to the guardians and than the guardians fight bad owls and they win and save owldom they all get to live happily ever after um my other complaint other than that theres like nothing light or funny in this story to break up the slumber mood is the battle itself You cant tell which are the good owls which are the bed owls they really needed to somehow set them apart with armor or I mean some of them wear armor but some on both sides wear armor anyway this is one you can skip or you can see up to you and thats it now off to go help with my six um bye 
 this movie is directed by steven summers whose claim to fame is the mummy franchise and he really seems to be channeling michael bay in this movie the plot has the consistency of swiss cheese and its really glossed over with lots of stunning special effects and big explosions sigh all in all its kind of a disappointment to any of us who grew up in the 80s and are used to the toys in the cartoon i feel like it almost should have had a g rating it was really kind of dumb down for us and i hate to say that i think you will really LOVE this movie if you are 8 but if you are a child who grew up in that time period youre not going to enjoy this movie very much because they arent playing to you theyre playing to a new audience of kids who dont know anything about these characters in the first place the plot involves some tiny little machines sometime in the future that can destroy cancer cells and have become weaponized and bad people are trying to steal the warheads and so a government secret group called gi Joe is trying to protect them from the bad guys channing tatum is the lead he starrs as duke hes from the step up movies i guess which i havent seen and all i can is hes a pretty average guy i dont really feel any emotional pull from him in this movie even a scene where he proposes to his girlfriend in a flashback he barely bats an eye his best friend is played by marlon mayans he plays rip cord marlon wayans kind of plays a watered down version of himself from other movies he does some stereotypical things like talking uh about busting a cap while flying an airplane but otherwise hes just there to be the best friend and hes pretty average too the two women in this movie are particularly good looking and they kick a lot of butt uh sienna miller and rachel nickols one on each side there and they kick each others butt they kick other peoples butt and so thats pretty entertaining this is a really big movie for their careers because i havent really seen them in a lot of big movies other notable mentions dennis quaid plays hawk leader of the gi joes and his performance is campy and comes off as an army cheerleader some of the time laughing jonathan price is the president he is average brendan frasier shows up in a cameo for a training montage and its sh so short lived he barely needs to even be there uh stormshadow is very cool his fight sequences are very neat and he delivers a lot of intensity snake eyes you never see his face but it turns out he is played by the guy who played toad in the first xmen movie and he also kicks a lot of butt he never gives up the villain 
 hey whats up Its Jaff its Geek and i its time for another episode of At the movies with the Geek this week were going to look at the movie Clash of the Titans which is a reboot I guess it would be the best term for the I believe it was a 1981 movie Clash of the titans um unfortunatelly Im going to have to say this movie was terrible um I was really looking forward to it I was a little hasitant at firstyou know as you are with with reboots you know is it gonna be good but as the trailers came out I I really liked what I was seeing I think that music that music they kind of pull it with the soundtrack really got me excited about seeing this movie and and being a fan of the original I was I was looking forward to seeing it but to me someone needs to release the Crackon on this movie and just totally destroy it because I just felt like it was it seemed like it was a rushed movie it seemed like there was no story development in it um I just really didnt have good time I felt like Medusa really wasnt that scary um maybe it was coz I was a kid back at that day but Medusa was a lot scar scarier then um I just think they made her almost looked too you know they tried that you know make her look too beautiful but um I just in whole really didnt like this movie the screen you know was that I I kind of fo found myself you know wanted to lay my head back and take a nap and actually the guy sitting next to me actually was taking a nap laughter he kept dozing off and and after the movie um going out into the theater into the lobby I had noone I heard noone say anything good and my friedns who were there had nothing good to say about it so unfortunatelly I must say this one is probably gonna be waiting until it comes on HBO or get it at um um red box for a buck um I just really didnt like it um but hey if youre looking to spend some money um go check it out maybe you will like it but um from my review Im gonna say Im gonna give it two thumbs down release the Cracken on this movie dont go see it go see something else How to train the dragon and um thats all Im gonna say about that so disappointment definately I did not wanna give this movie a bad review I Im a fan of the original you know loved it and um but I got to I got to do my duty and let you guys know its a a major suck fest so laughter we will talk to you later Hopefully with better news um coming up here soon Im gonna have a review for kick ass Heard good things about the screenings on that and um looking really forward to seeing that movie so hopefully I have a good review on that and um maybe well see at the movie soon 
 hi my name is lily and today im gonna be giving a movie review over the smurfs i saw it um a few nights ago and i decided hm im gonna come and review it but it was a good movie id give it three stars only because it was very predictable very predictable not gonna give any like spoilers but very predictable um i saw it last night with my aunt and her boyfriend im not supposed to tell anyone that she brought her boyfriend cuz no one ever erase the last thing i just said that would be great that um i guess the only other problem i had with it was that um the jokes were really cheesy i dont like cheesy jokes but cheesy jokes are most times funny cuz theyre really bad so if thats the case then you should see this movie if you really like cheesy jokes predictable movies but other than that it was a perfect family movie i would definitely take 8 or younger kids to that movie its a definite family movie beyond this age the problem i had with the movie theatre is there were kids crying the whole time and whispering xxx does baby crying get on your nerves ever if it does wouldnt recommend going to this movie cuz theres a bunch of kids or sneak into a really late showing cuz i dont think kids are going to be out that late but thats the only problem i had with it other than that it was a good movie it was cute you know the actors did a great job bringing the smurfs to life such as joe george lopez neil patrick harris katy perry and a fourth it was a great movie and i loved it but i had a few problems so i didnt love it i liked it three stars for smurfs and stay smurfy everyone 
 hi this is my frist reviw in like ever um I just saw the Clash of the titans movie it couldve been better the first one was a lot better They couldve made Zeus a little less sparkly it was very distracting um it was very hard to follow the first one made more sense and the crackon you know in the preview is like so much hype they pretend theres gonna be this big scene it maybe lasts about a minute and I was like is that it and than its definatelly not a 3D movie the previews are much more 3D the ne so yeah it was very disappointing I give it about one and a half stars so thats thumbs down if you dont understand so it is not a buy but the CGI was great and thats exectly how I thought a giant scorpion would look with the piece of driftwood that had blue fire on it um Medusa was way different from Percy Jackson and Glandon Laws which BTW Im getting tomorrow because I got 100 dollars for doing an essay so yeah throat cleaning but the best part about the movie I ve got a free pair of glasses and you might be a like well they tell you to recycle hahaha haha so kind Im saving the environment coz they have to run this through pure alcohol then just xxx plastic but repackaging it so Im saving the environment I just reduced my carp and footprint by stealing this glasses 
 so im gonna talk about the movie something borrowed featuring kate hudson uh jennifer goodwin that one dude from the office and a guy who looks a lot like tom cruise um lip smacking this movie is dumb uh i personally think its a waste of money just because i cant stand movies that are so predictable laughing i just just cant stand movies where its like the same plot as like 50 other million movies just different just different people playing the roles i really dont care to see those but you know what i took a chance you know i like kate hudson so i thought this movie would be funny and dont get me wrong there were you know funny parts in the movie i just dont care for the plot i dont care for basically any of it because its predictable so the plot is jennifer goodwin her name is rachel shes the only character in the movie that i knew the name of because i really am oblivious to life and dont pay attention to things so rachel is this underdog kind of girl her best friend kate hudson um steals her um college um law school crush um you know mr dreamy whatever not real anyways lip smacking so she steals him and uh couple years later theyre gonna get married what happens basically is that um she has sex with her best friends fiance which is her law school crush they just go at it in the back of a cab which is if i was the cab driver i would of just pull over and kick them out because i would never deal with people making out in the back of my cab um anyways that has nothing to do with the movie so you can pretty much already guess whats gonna happen uh you know during this movie its the same you know rise and fall the underdog you know she gets the guy but shes in trouble you know cuz she doesnt wanna tell her best friend blah blah blah and then uh she loses the guy because the guy doesnt wanna make a decision whether or not he wants uh rachel or her best friend and so shes all sad walking in the rain blah blah blah and then she gets the guy back and then her best friend sleeps with like this one dude named like marcus or something and uh shes pregnant with his baby and blah blah blah ive been saying that a lot in this video blah blah blah blah um yea so anyways its really predictable i mean you can go see i personally didnt like it because i just got really bored with it um and its really unpredictable i just get so tired of unpredictable movies like these guys in the 
 hey everybody whats going on its time for new episode of Lance TV Im a little late to the game coz Im gonna do a Sucker punch review and I feel like everyone in the world has already seen and reviewed Sucker Punch its like the most reviewed movie of the year so far and lot of the reviews were a lot of fun Ion 9 did a did a big long piece about it that was pretty funny and um Stupid for movies had this really long like really not really long but like really intense rent a about it um and Ill Ill touch Ill touch on a lot of those issues that they raises well but I wanted to give my own two cents I saw last night I knew it was supposed to be really bad but curiosity got the best of me and I I see all those kind of cult movies like this um I just I didnt wanna be left out of the the converstation um it was playing right down the street at the Vista which is my favorite theater here in LA so you know I went to go see it um and it it is just like everybody saying it is bad I dont think its like the worst movie Ive even seen just this year I mean Ive seen a lot of movies this year coz I was doing this week in movies but I would say I I enjoyed Sucker punch like I was more entertained by it than Battle LA which was just a slog and boring and I just try to totally uninteresting and Sucker punch is a failer but like a really ambitious weird the interesting idiosyncratic failure um it is bad but its not bad I think the way most people have been saying its bad its not bad in the way I was expecting it to be bad um it really is not trying to be a dramatic film or an action film like I think most people thats their knock on it is that its not you know conventionally satisfying as like you know with drama that we dont get to know anything about these characters their play isnt interesting their path to freedom is not compelling and its basically telescoped within the first ten minutes of the movie where were sort of told whats gonna happen before it happens um and and all those things are true but I dont think its trying to be that I think its really much more like a musical and I know this is gonna sound silly coz its such a broad goofy mainstream cult kind of movie but it really has more in common with a musical or and opera or even a ballet than a regular narrative film coz like am remains in narrative film is about character development and plot and then spectacle like in third place so its like puts some people in it and youre gonna enjoy spending time with them therere some funny dialogue make them compelling in their relationships compelling and then have a story thats like at five minutes this happens and at ten minutes this happens that like moves forward and has momentum and then you know put in some action or some romance or sex or whatever like to keep people sort of engaged um and thats what traditionl narrative movies do and this movie is really much more like the plot is what little there is and the characters are they are all just place holders its really like like if you went to go see the ballet and its about the spectacles like the story of Swan lake is why people go see Swan lake its the movement and the dancing and the music and the sets and the experience 
hey Mr xxx review here for um Transformers Dark side of the moon also known as Transformers 3 I went to this movie very very excited Im a big Transformers fan I think um the movies are phenomenal especially that first one um I dont think that this ove got as much buzz and as much um media attention and um word of mouth you know spreading around and stuff I didnt see basically any commercials on TV for it Im a big internet guy so I saw a lot of stuff on the internet but um didnt see as much as I did for the second and the first one um in interviews Shia LaBeouf said that the second movie lacked um heart and he said that this new one has a lot of heart um similar to the first one um after watching this movie I dont really think thats necessarily true um I think that the second movie and the third movie are very very similar um I think they tried to add a lot of heart I mean hes got this new girlfriend obviously Megan Foxx was fired so hes got this new girlfriend and it just seems like too much too fast I mean theyre already telling each other that love each other and talking about getting wedding rings spending the rest of their lives together they live together I mean its just way too much too fast they try to built their heart into it by you know him saying you know youre the only thing that matters in this world you know I dont care about myself you know coz she thinks hes doing crazy stuff sacrifizing his life in a then he does crazy stuff to save her and hes just like I love you you know just all the sappy blah blah stuff theres too much too fast I mean we basically just get introduced to this character and you know right away um this is the first movie shes in and theyre already um you know um meant to be together forever and all that good slushy stuff this movie seemed um a little long I love my movies to be long um I dont think a movie can ever be too long um you know I like you know the dark night was you know two hours and forty five minutes you know and TItanic you know all those movies a Avatar all those movies that you know three hours and you know thats fine by me I love long movies um Im passionate about movies so thats fine but this one seemed long at some at some parts some parts just kind of dragged on you kind of you know sit in the movie theater and this is a big action movie one of the biggest movies of the summer and you kind of just wanted to you know rest your head while watched um coz some of the sequences and some of the scenes were just kind of long and you just kind of like OK lets get to it we know whats gonna happen lets go ahead and do it um the action was great you know not too much not too little just um just enough action um the story was all right but pretty good script I dont think it was as good as the first one obviously I I think the first movie was just fantastic um maybe Im part with the second one maybe Im little behind that but it was it was pretty good story the cast of this movie um its pretty huge um of course all the returning stars and than you know youve got people coming in they werent in the original movies um Ken Jeong I think his name is um and obviously that Chinese th 
 what can I say about the Predators movie I guess thats exactly you would expect from the movie in this genre a group of people the bad guys discover as to what the bad guys are and in the big long thing is who lives and who dies nothing new is brought in those Predator series no surprises no big twist no finish I like to tease some mystery and great plot what couldve been but than all is explained and disppeares ten minutes later its just a clear remake of Predator from back in 1997 with the premise being almost identical althought what wasnt the same was the connection to each other which first movie had and this one not in the first run they were a team and they worked together and you see the personalites this movie just pops a group of different killers down together and lets them interact poorly you dont see any of the personalities when one dies you dont mourn over tham an you dont get an attachment to anybody of the acting nothing stands out a spectacular which is to be expected of the movie like this but nothing sucks either which gains the movie some points I guess the film is xxx cast though with the Im trying to be bad ass Brody as a selfelected leader a doctor played by Topher Grace and a short camio in the way of Laurence Fishburne what disappointed me was that one of the most hyped actors in the movie was only in there for short amount of time and I know you cant hype a movie with an unknown actors so even if someone is in there for a few minutes you should hype them but its just a little weak overall for me than we were looking forward to him and he was gone quickly although what it did do was interesting but i but it didnt make sense he co Laurence Fishburne comes in and tells the characters things that only screen writers shouldve known about which gives a little more of f fony feel this whole thing just like one of the girls tells the exact story of the first movie its a pointless scene for the audience and the characters it dosent give an give any insight or help its just make them seem like she sa she saw the first movie in finale I would only recommend this movie for a rental non in theater because its a low grade sequal to the 87th version and only if you like the series 
 hey everybody its a movie maniac again I just want to critique another movie I actually rented um someone was asking me about that movie Bridal Wars they kept asking me is it the good movie shell I see it is it funny coz it looked pretty funny So hey I decided to check it out what can I say Im just curious um staring Kate Hudson I believe and Anne Hathaway dont get me wrong Kate Hudson is is pretty fine looking but I just think its kind of stupid everyone says has a fat ass yes she has a fat ass in terms of white girls but her ass isnt really that fat first of all the movie was boring I mean the movie really wasnt funny at all all the all the funny parts werent funny I mean the movie was I guess it was a waste of time this guy wants to know so he can show buy it for his girlfriend I wa hey she might like it but even then its not really funny at all Anne Hathaway is really over rated in my opinion I mean her acting is like so so and I cant believe she even won a Oscar beleive she won an oscar or for best supporting actress or best actress something I mean that movie was a waste of time its two girls trying too hard and it just really wasnt good I mean thats my opinion check it out you might think otherwise but Im just telling you what I think and thats basically what I think so if you wanna know about any other movies let me know Im taking calls for any movies if therere movies you hear about but just dont know if you wanna spend the money to go buy it or rent it to see it let me know and Ill do it Ill watch it for you so until next time let me know whats going on tell me what you think 
 hi everyone welcome to Toffers movie review so its Saturday June 7 and just like said last night I went out today to see Kung fu panda so heres what I thought I was a little bit disappointed in the film the movie does star Jack Black um courses his voice over for a panda who wants to learn kung fu and become a famous dragon master and basically save the world now thats his life long dream now his father who by the way is a duck Um has a dream for him of becoming the owner of the noodle shop um now of course there is an all star cast that has Angelina Jolie Jackie Chan Lucy Liu Seth Rogan all of course that have voice over parts but the movie itself was just a little dry it didnt have a whole out of humor going on with it at least none that really made you wanna laugh out loud um even the kids and the audience itself just kind of chuckled a little bit gave a few laughs now Im not gonna lie therere a few parts that have great action sequences now even though it is an animated film it did have some great fight scenes um but as far as humor goes not as much as I was expecting everything you see in the trailer itself was pretty much all the humor youre gonna see in the movie um um a you know along with the xxx I would probably saying go see this movie an early showing dont spend a lot of money for the night viewing um maybe better like next time Dreamworks but for this one for me it just wasnt what I was hoping it would be I love the Shrek films I liked Ants but as far as Kung fu panda goes I was hoping for a lot more It just wasnt there for me I dont know next weekend um we have the Happening coming out and the Incredible hawk so maybe next week Ill have some better reviews for you 
hissing Im back sorry for the long wait I really have no justification for why Ive been gone for so long I mean I havent really seen that many movies since 127 hours but I just I dont know I couldnt master the will power to make a video Im really really sorry but I can promise you Im back for good now you know why because I saw five movies today and the one of them the first one is what Im going to review to xxx you guys right now it is Tron legacy this movie has been hyped up for months and months Disney has been marketing that crap out of this movie I I mean its just its literally been everywhere main draw for me for this movie was just the fact that its set in this like ridiculous world with all these bright beautiful colors and ridiculous action sequences Tron Legacy is this sequel to the 1982 classic Tron and I dont think thats a very good movie but I do think its a very interesting one its a first movie that used like legitimate special effects like um like they use computers like to generate part of the movie and that have not been done before ever and considering the first movie was a massive innovation theres obviously a lot of expectations of this one um you know Disney poured at least 300 million into this movie um a lot of expectations where writing on it so what do I think of Tron Legacy I can tell you that Tron Legacy is not a good movie but I was still ridicilously entertained by it are these two things possible in the same sentanceI I really do think so let me um th just let me explain tron Legacy is a movie where on most counts that I judge movies it kind of fails the performances are nah the script can be horrible its its a bit of a mixed bag coz there were some very bright moments um the direction is a bit its wobbly basically a lot of elements that I could take a movie on its really wobbly but what it lacks in those areas it most definately makes up for just like sheer visual spectacle I mean this movie has the most gorgeous visuals out of any movies since probably Avatar me if not prettier so many moments in this movie that are just framed and lit so perfectly that so that you just go like kind of huh thats really really cool and then take that world that have been set like a crap tunnel of really kinetic really well done action sequences in it and you have Tron Legacy I I cant belive I havent like explained the plot of this movie yet so its set literally inside the computer it it doesnt make much sense I know and basically um theres this kid named Sam flinth um um hes dad was a head of a big coorporation and then he disappeared twenty years ago and for whatever reason Sam um he gets a page telling him to go to an old araade that his dad owned and basically this makes no sense but he ends up in the computer um and there he basically has to fight his way out to survive but then he finds his dad in an also 
 hi this is cheeseburger man from xxxby the review and this is my straightforward review of Drive Angry 3D now this movie is just ridiculous and I I thought it was excellent um stars Nicolas Cage as a man who escapes from hell because he wants to rescue his granddaughter coz she was kidnapped by satanic worshipers and they wanna sacrifize her so they can bring hell on earth now Nicolas Cage runs into Amber Heard character she was a waitress and she kind of becomes an unofficial sidekick of Nicolas Cage in this movie now she was really xxx in it I felt because they needed something hot to look at on the screen for an hour and forty minutes her acting was pretty bad she didnt really do anything for me but the real star that fell out of this movie was William Fichtner character or William Fichtner I should say his character was the accountant of hell and his job was to bring Nicolas Cage back to the other world now Nicolas Cage isnt really known for his acting lately coz hes had a lot of bad movies and his acting wasnt really good in that movie but it made it hysterical and it was just funny with all of these little one liners that he had and whatever so no Im not saying this movie is bad coz its its not its everything I expected it to be Like I said before it had tacky one liners that were just hysterical there was just plenty of blood um there was there was plenty of sex there was plenty drugs and rocknroll whatever you want it it was it was good um one of the big things I was disappointed though was I felt that they couldve done a lot more with 3D I thought I was expecting to see more body parts flying around after they were shot up by shotguns but I mean it just it just didnt happen um there were a lot of gun fights and some really cool gun fights but there were just people getting shad with blood and splatter and I thought it was just gonna be more than that but so I was a little disappointed in that um now I dont really recommend this if you go on a date with some girl um but if youre xxx movie goer like I am I totally recommend seeing this because its just a fun entertaining movie and I think that you will enjoye it 
the verdict is stupid and a complete waste of money not mine I mean sort of mine but it was a fun experience going like I didnt expect it to be good but its just such a waste of money for them like when I see the movie thats obviously had a very big budget and it is like not even good it makes me angry coz Im just like why are you wasting so much money aaaaa it wasnt even holding my attention I could barely stay awake through the movie I honestly wanted the aliens to win and Im gonna talk spoilers now all the characters were just so unlikable just there was only one character the doctor he was the only person I even really cared about and even he was a douchebag all of them every single cowboy was just a complete douchebag and there was just this little boy and he was the only person who wasnt a douchebag but he wasnt even interesting his mom was dead and his dad hadnt seen him a year so like I really like supposed to feel a little bad for him or something but they gave him no no character like he had no character development whatsoever he was just like a plot device for this other guy to start acting like a father figure and he was just stupid but then he didnt even act like a father figure towards him he was just like oh I shall be your father figure but then I realize I should be a father to my own son goodbye child and Harrison Ford from the trailers for some reason I got the idea that he was a sheriff but he was actually complete douchebag who just ran the town with his business Daniel Craigs character so he had like amnesia right like an am someone who has amnesia like usually theyre like really confused just like you know vulnerable and this guy was like the complete opposite he didnt know what was going on so he just killed everyone he met like I dont know whats going on Im confused so Im just gonna kill you all why are you killing everyone it just some people were like oh hes so cool hes so awesome like youve never seen that in the movie this person who had amnesia just kills everybody even if its like but that was so unnecessary whay are you killing these people you dont even know whats going on like dude get over yourself he looked awesome while he did it but yeah OK so let all the girls who want all disagree with me coz they all think this is an amazing movie but they all think he was amazing because they were staring at Daniel Craig the whole time theyr going oh my gosh hes so hot all the guys that went were pretty much on my page they were just like wow that was stupid wow so I sat with the guys the girls set up higher than I did I sat with the guys and we all try to stay awake through it um and kept falling asleep and then talk about how stupid it was it was Cowboys and aliens but theres a reason they didnt call it cowboys versus aliens coz the cowboys and the aliens they dont they barely even fight at all coz thay cant like the cowboys s stand no chance all it is is like Daniel Craigs character has this thing that can blow them up oh goody for him then they get Indians involved and the Indians the ca 
hi guys i just saw the movie friends with benefits and im going to review it for you i took some notes so im gonna read what i wrote down i guess before i get into specifics um ill just say like the basic um overall thoughts on the movie i dont really know i dont its so weird i there were times in the movie where i felt really bored and there were times that i thought it was funny and there were times that i was just sitting there after they said their jokes and i was like thats not nobodys laughing thats not funny i just dont think it was very good and this is the thing friends with benefits and no strings attached they are the same movie different ways of getting to the same point but its the same point so i think that no strings attached was better than friends with benefits i was not bored during no strings attached i thought it was very funny um and uh friends with benefits had its moments butsigh it had a lot of really bad moments i dont know im gonna im gonna go through the things that i wrote down and well see if i can give any more information on this richard jenkins is in this movie and he is one of my favorite actors ever he is brilliant there is not a movie that i see him in that i dont end up crying because he is so fantastic and he just breaks your heart whenever he does you know a role that usually his roles do break your heart at some point so definitely did in this movie i like teared up in friends with benefits because of him the lady who plays justin timberlakes sister um i thought she was very good in this movie and i thought she was just like really natural and funny and she looks like renee zellwegger and helen hunt from a twister movie and she talks like her too does anybody else like if youve seen it dont you think that she talks exactly like her it was weird the whole time i saw her all i thought was helen hunt and renee zellwegger another thing was the fact that there was not one healthy relationship or positive good relationship in this whole movie his sister and her son lived with his dad his his mom left his dad and him years ago and now his sister who isnt married and has a son who doesnt have a dad lives with the dad the son is ashamed of his dad then milas mom or whatever her name is jamies mom is an awful mother she doesnt even know who her dad is so its like and then they have a together they have an awful relationship so its like i dont know when i was watching it i was like people like their lives are awful like if you ever think about it maybe im looking too much into it but thats kind of depressing another thing that kind of is like to me if you do this thing that im gonna talk about right now it sort of is like you know that your movie is gonna 
 written by nicholas sparks and directed by judy ann robinson the last song starrs miley cyrus greg coullier and liam hensworth and its about a rebellious girl who is sent for the summer um to her father who lives in a southern city and through their love of music they begin to reconnect now i am a huge HUGE fan of nicholas sparks um the notebook is one of my favorite films um i really enjoyed a walk to remember me and dear john and which is his most recent one i really did enjoy as well wasnt too fond of the ending but thats for another another review so i went into this film having quite high expectations i mean its a nicholas sparks book it must be good but on the other hand i was really um wary of going like what to expect from miley cyrus um i mean shes only done the hannah montana franchise playing that one character which i think like 99 of the percent of the time her characters like so overboard shes so exaggerated so i really didnt know how she was going to handle this film straight away miley cyrus acting miley cyrus acting or lack of she had this same expression throughout the entire film it was like this like pouty like grumpy look and then maybe even when she was happy like she wouldnt frown her um frown her eyebrows but shed still be pouty but like yeah like that which just uh it REALLY annoyed me like those tho those those moments in the film especially in the beginning where she would sit there stand there cross um with her arms crossed and just look out into the distance like just laughing with the same expression or shed look across the beach or shed look at her dad or shed look at her brother with the same expression and i was just like whatre you thinking i i dont understand what this characters doing like okay shes staring whats she thinking how does she feel i had no idea like it was the same expression for shock or for sadness or what i presumed shed be sad but it sigh it really bugged me smacking lips and another thing that i read um in this magazine or had an interview was that she said she hadnt even read the novel i mean i havent read the novel so i cant really say anything but as an actor i really think especially an actor in the lead leading role you really should prepare for that role i was like how can you go into a film into a leading role and have no idea who your character is smacking so thats probably why she just laughinglooked the same in every single scene there was probably about two scenes that i actually thought yea she this is her acting this is good she can do this but then those two moments just got ruined by the rest of an hour and a half of her being pouty um however not all 
 hi folks um id like to quickly talk about machete im sorry and disappointed to say this i didnt like it i couldnt get into it i i actually knew what i was getting myself into i know it its not meant to be taken seriously maybe 70s exploitation movies are more cheesy than machete and maybe planet terror im im not sure im just guessing sound of cars the action and humor were mostly flat i i cant explain why the humor was was mostly flat because a few or several jokes actually felt they they they actually felt felt funny but but i just did didnt laugh sigh it probably would have helped if i went with with someone if at least one other one other person went with me sound of cars what whatever im just guessing again smacking lips maybe only 5 jokes made me laugh its its clear to me that steven segals death was supposed to be darkly funny and uh although like i like dark humor but i just couldnt find it funny i mean uh was it silly in a good way no i i i guess so i mean its its it wasnt annoying it it it was just there i i i i wasnt i wasnt amused i i knew obviously the movie would be gory maybe a lot more than the expendables but i feel that the movie wasnt really concerned with being exciting the action feels that its um it its its pretty much just uh quick cut or slash blood scream you know lip smacking fffflat shit lip smacking still the the church shootout however brief that was it it was alright maybe it could have been 20 seconds longer the the the final shootout

 Leap Year is a romantic comedy about a woman who flies to Ireland to propose to her boyfriend on Leap Day Which would have been a better name for the movie Unfortunately the plane lands on the other side of Ireland and she has to acquire an Irishman to get her to Dublin As they race against the clock many small problems arise to complicate their journey I rented the movie Leap Year a a few weeks ago with my friends and I really enjoyed it The countryside which they showed while going across Ireland was astoundingly ble beautiful And in the scene with the destroyed castle it really reminded me why I want to go there so badly Although I enjoyed the movie if I think about it honestly the plot wasnt that great Its a fun chick flick but other than that it doesnt really hold up under inspection lip smacking All the problems that come to stop them from getting to their destination are although plausible a little weak Even though the whole movie is based on whether she gets to Dublin in time youre never really worried about it because you know she gets there Lip Smakcing A lot of this movie brings a cute laugh here and there And both the actors Amy Adams and Matthew Goode work well with each other and seem to be really enjoying themselves the whole way through Even when theyre fighting in the movie though it just seems like its their banter not actual dislike All in all if youre looking for a cute romantic comedy with a beautiful setting then this will probably be a good movie for you

 welcome to this weeks movie review on Shrek the third starring Mike Myers Cameron Diaz and Abraham Shrek is already the second film that comes out as a sequel its the third installment of the series and we had Spirderman already and we had a ton of them coming up this summer and this is the one that I can say was definatelly disappointed I love the first Shrek and the second Shrek and I was really hoping that this one be just as good and it just that it hadnt anything new to offer I was really disappointed with that I mean I went in there hoping to see something original and funny like the first two and it offered nothing of the such it wasnt remotly funny there was a few jokes OK yeah make you giggle or something but thats nothing major nothing really that funny or anything original the characters are all the same and not even as good as the first two movies last ye the last Shrek that came out the second one introduces Puss in boots and I loved Puss in boots and he wasnt even that great this time around the donkey and puss in boots rivalry thats going on it just it wasnt as funny the third time around and there was nothing new to offer plain and simply it was dull for me it couldve been so much better I I couldve I saw it being so much better in my head but it just wasnt it disappointed me highly and I was just sort of discouraged after seeing the movie and Im definatelly wish I had my money back um it was a waste of my time and I dont suggest anyone go see it if youre hoping to if you have to have if you have kids and youre forced to go which you probably will if you have kids you know put up with it as a parent but on your own dont go see it its not really that great everyone is split on this one just as they were on Spiderman and just they are with all the other sequels that are coming out an this one I have to agree on the negative side it was not great it wasnt even remotely good I mean theres a few moments yeah that are original and funny and theres a ne an introduction of a new character Justine Timberlakes character already in the film but they didnt even give him that much to do the he had only few minor lines and none of them were really that great I mean stands out in your mind so the addition of this character was pretty pointless I mean its pleasent to the story but I still find it pointless in the end of the movie and the characters just werent the same as the first two that I fell in love with them it just kind of made me wanna really walk out of the theater to add to the problems I had a problem with the audio in my theater so that just pissed me off more but really I couldve shouldve just walked up and left at that moment it was boring and not at all original in my opinion it couldve been so much better than the second sequel was really great and I loved it and this one just was a flat of disappointments so Im gonna rate this one two stars it shouldve really be one but Im gonna give it a two to be fair because the movie did have some points when I was laughing but very few and it wasnt worth it in my opinion to go see it so I definatelly suggest 
This is the one minute review of Suckerpunch Poop music in background laughing currently in theatres starring no one youve ever heard of directed by zach snyder who also directed watchmen 300 the legends of gahul guardians of owl land whatever that came out and i never saw it breathing in deeply so heres the thing with this movie i actually saw this movie a couple weeks back ive been kind of on a one minute review hiatus sorry and so i never really see other reviews before i do mine but i have seen some reviews of suckerpunch and this suckers getting this sucker is getting panned like last airbender garbage panned and i wanna say this i did not think it was like last airbender garbage um heres why yes stuttering t theres problems with this and i wanna talk about them but you know it looks beautiful there are some really cool uh moments in this it actually has some some them thematically it has some cool themes about heroism and about like taking ownership of yourself and things like that which i resonated with and i whi and which i appreciated but heres the essential problem with this movie the essentail problem of this movie well maybe this would be the best way to put it um there was a uh a comedian named dave chapelle um and dave chapelle um and another comedian chris rock are um african american and in their comedy they sometimes take on african american culture what they perceive to be african american culture and so they will essentially make fun of black people and the thing with dave chapelle and with chris rock is because theyre black they can kinda do that and theres something about that thats acceptable um if like me or laughing some other white person or hispanic person or whatever did the same jokes it would not be funny it would be completely inappropriate in fact it would be racist so zach snyder here is making a movie thats ostensibly about female empow empowerment but its a movie about female empowerment which includes a lot of clearing throat slapping that includes a lot of women in bustiers that includes a lot of violence done against women and ultimately in which most of the women end up completely disempowered clapping laughing so okay if zach snyder were a woman i would say okay shes making a comment about the way women cant be empowered in male dominated societies in the way men um distract and and hurt and damage women and prevent them from asserting who they really are i could kinda see that in a sort of chris rock dave chapelle way but zach snyder is a guy and because of that this stuff kinda ends up looking like the sh he man woman haters club so if i give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt this is a movie that looks great has some bad acting and has way too much violence against women if i dont give zach snyder the benefit of the doubt 
 hello again Frank one two castle I know its been a quite long time since Ive done one of these but um I was very busy and you all probably saw movies over Christmas that you wanted to see anyway so Im back Anyway I went to go see Green Hornet which of course stars Seth Rogan who also helped write the movie um it was directed by Michel Gondry it stars other actors such as Jay Chou Christopher Christoph Waltz and Cameron Diaz um the Green hornet is a it was just like a radio a radio show like a let alone ranger and the green hornet was essentially like batman he was um a normal guy who used um gadgets and his side kick to stop to felt fight crime usually the natzis but thats not what this movies about um huh the way the green hornet was done via Seth Rogans point of view it was parody um the green hornet which is um his real name is Britt Reid he dosnt know how to do much um when he fights his xxx he has now science behind it in fact most of the work is done by Kato Kato fights for the green hornet um he makes the black beauty which is the car that green hornet uses he makes gadgets for the green hornet and he dosent get that much recognition but he helps out because he wants to fight for good um the movie starts off as as any superhero movie would you have character you have the main character who has a crisis happen in his life and he becomes a hero thats what this movie is um I thought the character is well done I loved how Seth Rogan played the green hornet I loved how Jay Chou played Kato they did a very good job Christoph Waltz he plays the bad guy he was the bad guy in Inglorious bastards um he just keeps doing that you know the bad guy where hes he seems calm but deep down hes an insane psychopath well he plays that well so hes a good villain he also has some really cool guns so that its like a desert eagle but it has to barrels to it its pretty pretty scary looking I wouldnt want that pointed at me um then Cameron Diaz plays the love interest um shes a very very very bright um bright journalist and um Britt Reid hires her on her good looks but he finds out theres actually a lot more of her than he initially thought and hes always trying to like um try to scare to fall in love with him but of course shes she doesnt wanna anything to do with him and I who would I mean Seth Rogan but anyw anyway I digress um like I said I thought the movie was great the action they do have is really well done um they did a good job with car they did a good job with the fight scenes they did like xxx almost fight scenes where they slow down they go through everything um 
 hello youre watching watch this fucking movie my name is jen and i will be reviewing blue valentine for you today so i saw blue valentine in theatres a while back and i really really loved it and i thought that the performances in it were incredible and i was just thinking about um how its the performances in it were sort of over overlooked at the academy awards because um there were so many great movies that came out this year i mean um the kings speech black swan 127 hours inception and uh if im missing any im sorry um theyre just off the top of my head but there were a lot of great movies out this year some of the great performances um of last year were kind of overlooked cuz there were just so many of them and i think that blue valentine has um become kind of underrated so blue valentine is about a married couple on the verge of uh you know a collapse they are they used to be in love they were in love and they have a child together but um as you see from the beginning of the movie everything just seems to be falling apart like they dont seem to be connecting anymore um theres no communication between the two of them so the husband played by ryan gosling um decides to take his wife whos pl played by michelle williams uh they go up to some kind of sleazy hotel to as like a last ditch attempt to finally connect again as they used to when they were younger and as this movie uh progresses you co you sort of see these flashbacks of uh when they were first met and the kind of love that uh that was between them at the at the initial stages of their relationship and its truly heartbreaking to see that contrasted with the state of things uh in the present when you see them you know they they almost hate each other and you see the husband trying to reach out to his wife but the wife um it seems like she cant even stand him she cant really stand being around him and she um doesnt respect him and smacking lips all sorts of things and theres a lots of smacking lips theres so many dynamics going on with this relationship and i think that it was it was a great story so uh blue valentine what did i think of it it was after i got out of the theatre I sort of thought to myself wow ive seen so many movies about broken relationships about couples that are on the verge of divorce and its sort of like a contrived plot thats been used over and over again because its um its an audience pleaser you know an especially when it comes to romantic dramas like thumping its uh it gets the audiences to theatres because its a compelling idea but its been uh done 
I appologize that I have been kind of neglecting movie reviews lately because things have been really really busy but I do wanna tell you about Priest Priest stars Paul Bettany Its based on a graphic novel and it is crazy basically priests are trained to kill vampires and they are super awesome they basically have super human abilities when it comes down to it if you were looking for a movie that has anything realistic in it you should not be looking at this movie because it is insane if you like explosions really ridiculous action sequences malodramatic plot and acting this is the right movie to see the premise is that Paul Bettanys character is contacted about the kidnapping of a young girl from a Wasteland community and he has a connection to this girl through family and he wants to get her back because he knows shes been kidnapped by vampires even though the church who is like big brother within the cities will not allow it and theyre denying the vampires continue to exist so off he goes breaks bonds with church goes out in search of the girl Maggy Cue is a priest and shes sent out after him and she also has pretty sweet moves and is fun to watch some really fun touches within the movie is that two vampires in other shows appear in this movie not as vampires one of them is Steven Moyer who you know as vampire Bill from True blood he plays the father of the kidnapped girl young fellow that plays sheriff Hicks was the vampire that kidnapped Bella in the first Twilight movie and he is helping look for the kidnapped girl as well therere also two Lord of the rings grads which I absolutely love and anyone who knows me knows the Lord of the rings trilogy is probably my favorite movie ever if all three of them were put together yeah thats about how my favorite list goes but Carl Urban plays Black hat Black hat is a former priest and Brad Durraff who was Wormtongue in the Lord of the rings serie plays salesman which basically means hes Wormtongue again in a different way other notable mentiones are Christopher Plumber plays the monk senior whos like the head of the church and Lily Collins plays Lucy the kidnapped girl and she is a really pretty girl the last time we saw her was probably in the blind side this is one of my favorite types of movies I really love the melodramatic over the top crazy action sort of thing going on theres s scene in a cave where they fight a giant monster that really reminds me of like some sort of Lord of the Rings mines of moria moment and theres a better on top of the train fights than the first mission impossible movie so yes I really enjoyed it I thought it was fun and I enjoyed myself a lot at the movie I laughed at quite a bit of the dialogue and there actually was one scene that I found kin 
 Hey this is Cheeseburger Im out here with Hard Body Review Today I am reviewing Rango Now Rango was just fantastic Surprised me uh it was so much better than I thought it was going to be Uh this movie stars Johnny Depp voiced as the main character which was a chameleon named Rango and he was just a normal household pet Got into a freak accident wound up in a desert stumbled across this town and this town was like from a good old Western It had all this stereotypical traits of a Western town Um with the like the townspeople and wha like the they were they didnt ride on horses They they rode on like some weird birds and stuff like that I dunno but it was it was cool It was a great movie Um And throughout the movie Johnny Depp kinda became like the unsung hero and During the movie he was trying to find his himse his true self like who he really is Um just trying to help these people in the town And Now what I loved about this movie was like the supporting characters in this movie Um all the oh God The all the animals were just so funny Um they all played off each other Theyre like the dumb kinda cowboys that dont know what theyre doing always asking dumb questions staying saying stupid shit and it was just oh it was hysterical There was this one character he was like a bird and he had an arrow going through one eye and out the back of his head laughing and the stuff he said was just it was just so funny Um Now Gor Vivinsky who directed this movie hes known for all the Pirates of the Caribbean movies um he brought his live action directing to his first knocking animated feature and he did a wonderful job All the cinematography in this movie was great Like all the sunsets and all the landscapes of the films they just looked so realistic in every almost every scene Um Like this movie had great action sequences This aw this one really cool action sequences where like this Ronny uh Johnny Depps posse they were getting chased by all these like possums or nah I wouldnt say possums but prairie dogs I dont know Some kind of animal Im not even sure what they were But they were just chasing them and all these like bats and aw it was just so cool Like a covered wagon horse kinda cowboy chase sequence Oh it was so cool Um But this movie it had everything Humor romance action of course um it was just It was fun it was a fun entertaining movie Uh it was good for the entire family Um definitely recommend checking seeing this uh checking this movie out Uh I rated it four out of five stars Um The one thing I didnt like about this movie was they brought the main chara uh the bad character I should say in kinda late But that didnt really matter Um everything else held up its own Um definitely check out this movie Rango Uh in a theatre near you 
 Hey Amber here Uh just doing a really quick review on my own Uh I really enjoyed doing them for the Philly D movie club so I thought oh why not I just went to the movies on Sunday so uh here is my review for uh Rango Uh Rango is a really cute movie about a chameleon that gets lost on the freeway somewhere down South And uh finds himself in a little town called Dirt that uh has a water problem and he ends up being their Sheriff because him being this uh big actor chameleon back in his own mind he basically convinces the town that hes tough and that hes hed be a really good Sheriff for the town and hell solve all of their water problems Um I I liked a lot of the movie I will admit Im a big Johnny Depp fan um I pretty much will go see any movie that kind of has an interesting plot if hes in it just to see if uh his his acting capabilities are are up to to par in it Um Its not his best Ive seen him in other cartoons I mean Corpse Bride hes really good in Corpse Bride and Rango kind of falls into that Well its a Johnny Depp movie so its entertaining but its not something that I would go buy or something I would recommend unless you have little kids to bring with you Um What else Oh it has some really good references of past Johnny Depp films in it Like while the chameleons getting bounced along the highway you run into Henry S Thompson Um He pulls out a lot of his voices in it Uh hes super entertaining as the chameleon I mean Johnny Depps a wonderful voice actor so um He hes I do hes an incredible voice actor Like thats really the best part of the movie is listening to him uh pull off all these different voices and be this really quirky little chameleon Um I I would yeah I would recommend it if you have little kids but if you dont really have any small friends Uh that sounded really perverted Small children that you are related to um to take to the movies uh I wouldnt go see it by myself I definitely will buy it but uh it was worth the free movie passes that I used on it um I will see you next time Im going to try to do a review on the book Children of the Men because I just finished that uh Make sure to check out the links below to my Twitter page and blog Uh my blog right now is currently only really book reviews but Im gonna try to integrate some of the movie reviews that Ive done in the past for the Philly D movie club into uh full written reviews as well So check those out theyre down in this section down there Um we will see you next time and thanks for listening to me ramble 
and Im gonna give you a review of JI Joe Rise of the Cobra hissing anyway I actually missed this movie when it came out in xxx because I really wanted to see it actually but I never was able to kind of connect and actually see it some things felt through never was able to see it just saw it on DVD rented it and um first of all I I actually was never a huge fan of the JI Joe TV series or big collector of the action figures um I watched a TV show every once in a while but I wasnt big on it um that being said I still got a lot of references that theyve made in the movie they even may a reference that said noone is half the battle and just in case you didnt read the above thing on my title this review is gonna have some spoilers in it so if you havent seen the movie and you dont want me to spoil it you can watch my other video right now go click on that and watch that and um you know enjoy yourself with that video going back to JI Joe Rise of the Cobra um this movie is incredible cheezy but in the good way I in ist theres two types of cheezy and this is the good kind of cheezy yes it the acting is a little rough in some parts well you know um corny but the m the script is corny I mean the way its written is corny I mean I didnt go to this movie expecting to see the dark night and quite honestly I wish Ive seen this over the summer because if Ive seen it over the summer I probably wouldve rated it best action movie I saw this summer this summer was kind of weird with the action movies if you ask me I did like Transformers 2 even though a lot of people didnt like that but you know this movie um this really um wouldve made up for a disappointment that it had a terminator salvation um um this movie stars Channing Tatum um Marlon Wayans um Sienna Miller Christopher Eccleston Dennis Quaid and Rachel Nichols and um you know you have a lot of good actors in this movie actually a lot of good actors in you know theyre in there this is a cheezy um movie so you know its not like you actually getting like Academy Award quality acting performances um and now the performances are like something like to write home about um that being said you can tell that lot people were having fun with this and theres a difference between when an actor is dulling in a performance and when actor is having fun with the performance and I xxx like in particular Joseph Joseph GordonLevitt had a lot of fun with his role I think um Rachel Nichols had a lot of fun with her role Marlon Wayans had a lot of fun um I cannot pronounce his name but the guy from Lost had a lot of fun Dennis Quaid I think had a lot of fun um same with Christopher Eccleston so I I think it was cool to actually see Ray Park in action great action star he does a great job with his snake eyes which is always cool to see that um one thing I also like to add about this JI Joe movie is how international it was it was very divert 
 Lets talk Shrek Ever After Um lip smacking Not great The gist of the story is that Shrek is tired of his life now married with the kids so he really would like to relive his glory days He goes to Rumplestiltskin and signs a contract that in order to have a free day where he can relive his glory stuff he will give a day Unbeknownst to Shrek Rumplestiltskin takes the day that he was born so then Shrek doesnt exist And in order to get things back to how they were he has to um get Fiona to fall in love with him and they have to once again have true loves first kiss Sigh I really think what this was missing was that humor and that wit that than the other Shrek movies Um its just not there Its okay But its really not wonderful Nothing to rush out and see There arent a lot of kids movies out right now so and I guess normally Shrek is for adults but lack you know very lackluster Anyway Thats it Chuckle be forewarned Low expectations Okay And now its late so off to bed Ciao 
and i saw this movie just last night here is my review so much to say about this film but let me first say this i liked it more than i expected i would that said lets hit it this film is slavishly devoted to the original book or nov novella uh by uh charles dickens the language the words i mean the script comes directly from uh charles dickens original writing that means a lot of things number one it means its much scarier than you could imagine my 8 year old was terrified through part of this because the original version is terrifying uh number two ive heard a couple people talk about the christianity of this film let me say this if your christianity is extremely legalistic this is the film for you cause this is a film that basically says you know what you should do you should take care of poor people because jesus told us to take care of poor people and if you dont take care of poor people youre gonna burn in hell so laughing if thats your form of christianity its a christian film um its not my form so do with that as you please um another thing about this film is in its devotion is that sometimes my children could not understand what was being said because they were speaking dickensonian english sometimes i missed what was being said uh another thing is that charles dickens was making real social commentary on victorian england of his day therefore a lot of social commentary goes woop sound effect over your head or just really doesnt make any difference to us today at all um all this stuff about debtors prison for instance doesnt really um jive here in 21st century america now the animation of the film the thing about disney is that disney makes amusement park rides and this film is this amazing like i say slavish devotion to charles dickens with an amusement park ride it involved because this thing is is meant to be seen in 3D which i saw it in and throughout the film youre going sound effects laughing either from the terrifying characters or most likely from going very quickly through london with you know demon horses chasing you so uh theres that also about the animation the people just like in polar express a film i really did not like um the people seemed sort of dead you know everyones like yes welcome to the polar express except their eyes are kind of like this welcome to the polar express whatever now all those things being said and thats a lot to be said for a one minute review i actually like the film um i enjoyed myself in it you might as well i would not take a young child 
Robin Hood starring Russel Crow um first thing I got to say xxx I was dreading going in to see this movie the trailers werent really doing it much for me see neither are folks too much on epic than you know character development of this timeless tale that is Robin Hood and also therere these reviews I was reading about it I maen I think the most generous review Ive read give it two out of five so I really was not looking forward to seeing this movie um but I guess say maybe my expectations were lowered by these other reviews that I read but I didnt mind it to be honest with you um I know its been a really just getting nail to cross as far as I you know movies going on a film festival right now but I didnt find it all that bad I didnt find it all that good like I said maybe my expectations were lowered because of all of those reviews but I really didnt hate it um I guess well start right off like what people could hate about this movie there are some negatives to say the least um really first and foremost it just lacked the charm of these past Robin Hood movies that we know I mean there was this classic Disney verstion which everyone watched when we were kids um theres men in tights which you know hilarious spoof of the story theres a Kevin Costner prince of fee version which was supposed to be the dark and edgy version of his time I mean but that was what thirteen years ago fourteen years ago probably more than that so maybe in Hollywoods eyes it was time for a remake and it just lacked the charm of those past movies it did seem to focus too much on epic epic epic and it really just lacked what made the other movies more enjoyable and suffers from what I call kingdom of heaven syndrom where it builds too much for these huge catastrophic war sequences theyre supposed to blow you away but the problem is you dont give a damn because it just lacks that charm of the past movies um not in all instances but the ones that matter the most yeah um Russel Crow and Cate Blanchette just did not sell it for me I had a very hard time just buying it like were supposed to believe that these two are in their mid wel you know mid thirties at the oldest and laughter theyre looking pretty rough in this movie like OK yeah Russel Crow is Robin Hood whos a crusaider and hes got back from a crusaids I can appreciate that hes not gonna be looking like a chipper bright young man but early thirties really you want me to buy that I cant do it especially when hes hanging around with a married men who all but one of them are probably early twenties laughter and one of them is maybe mid twenties and meanwhile theyre hanging in with papa Russel it just looks like you know its bunch of a guys hanging there so one brought dad along coz he offered to drive 
 Hey everybody hope youre having a great day and here is a quick review on Zookeeper Save your money wait til it comes out on rental For me it was a waste of time There were a few funny lines but after an hour I just said enough I had to walk out The movie theatre gave me credit to a future movie so that I appreciate it Uh if you like the kind of movie that Ben Stiller did a night at the museum then you probably would like something uh like this Uh if you didnt like that type of movie then I really dont think youre gonna like this at all and youre better off saving your money uh and maybe renting it when it comes out on uh video so Anyways I know this is a short review but just wanted to give my honest opinon if uh you liked it you know feel free to share any comments you have but uh theres definitely far better movies that you can uh go see than um tongue clicking than zookeeper so thanks for your time have a great day 
hey guys I told you that I would make a review for the movie Sex and the city 2 whats Im gonna do Im gonna start off with saying that I really wasnt very impressed with the movie um I watched a lot of the series and I own the first movie and I liked the first movie I thought the first movie was really good but this movie kind of came off like somebodys really sad travel video I dont know I mean that sounds really harsh but I just wasnt I just I dont know I didnt really like the movie all that much I mean I had some some good moments and a few funny parts but all in all I just thought it was really over overly sad I dont know I just thought I just thought it was really really sad um I mean if you really like the show and you really liked the first movie and you still wanna go and see this Im not gonna discourage you from seeing it I just personally I just didnt really enjoy it um it also really didnt need a lot of the things that it had in it like it couldve been shorter um its like over two hours but a lot of the footage was kind of unnecessary and I mean I dont know I just I feel like I dont mean if I have wasted those two hours I just feel like I couldve done something better with them I think that Charlotte and Miranda have some really nice moments in the movie I really think that I really like the Mirandas character actually the most upbeat character in the whole movie I think that um and that everybody I do feel really bad for Charlotte she does have a lot of issues and you really can kind of symphatize whether youve got to have kids I mean even if you dont have kids because its just just about getting getting time for yourself and not being really stressed out and I think that thats thats a very relatable issue I think that they all have like a lot of issues and that some are very relatable yeah I mean it it has some fun moments but all in all wasnt really that big of a fan I mean Im not gonna do like a spoiler section Im not gonna like and indeapth thing because there really wasnt all that much to it for me um like I said if you like it feel free to go see it I just personally wasnt that into it um yeah I mean if you wanna see a video um its gonna be who enjoyed a film if you do wanna see somebody whos possibly critiquing it Ill put a link for for the video um somewhere up here um its by um its Jill Strip and she really enjoyed the film um so if you like to hear a um like more positive review check out her review it is very good um just two of us in opinions but yeah I wanna talk about La rue for a second major laser I dont know if you guys are familiar with major laser but major laser and la rue and various others have collaborated um 
 nine ninety screening plus i am number four you cant go wrong with that i was not looking forward to see this movie but i went and i dig this movie i was happy to see it plus i had a good time im wanting to talk about the good things about this movie the first thing is the soundtrack there are some songs of popular band uh like kings of leon the xx um cybil twilight the soundtrack is good its really good some really great songs and the best thing about that is that all two songs um well not all of them but some of the songs are not well well connected with the scenes um anyways the music is good its stuttering that is a good thing the other thing is the directing i really dig the special effects of this movie there are a lot of action sequences like in the middle of the movie it starts with really great action sequences amazing special effects and the ending was really really great too its it was my favorite part of the movie the ending yeah now lets talk about the bad things the main problem of this movie is that this movie is SO cheesy i mean the blood is like twilight with some scifi with some action and with likable characters and that that is important guys the characters of i am number four are likable not like the characters of of twilight um the ending is open for a sequel and uh i am looking forward to see a sequel of this movie because i really dig this movie i really dig this movie the picture quality was really great i will even pick up this movie on bluray um anyways um the movie for me is three starts out of five stars three solid stars cause i had a good time and uh this movie i was not looking forward to see this movie but it was really good the acting is its normal its not bad its not bad at all uh i i have to say that the likable characters make this movie a really good movie im willing to go with friends alone with family to watch on a rainy day and if you can watch it at half price at a midnight show screening cause its worth it so yeah if you want to have fun this weekend go watch it watch this movie
